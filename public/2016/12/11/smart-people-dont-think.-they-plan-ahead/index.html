<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to develop a lot of dumb habits over the years.</p>
<p>Stalking. Self-harm. Self-obsession. Addiction. Irrational idealisation.</p>
<p>The kinds of habits developed by unadjusted people, because we&rsquo;re stupid and don&rsquo;t seem to know any better.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the cycle itself is fairly basic:</p>
<p>The dumb habit is developed, we assume everything is horrible, and we deny all responsibility and control over the situation.</p>
<p>We fuck up and crave some more, craving and craving until the cows come home.</p>
<p>Absolutely delicious.</p>
<p>One of these dumb habits of mine was developed quite innocently as a child.</p>
<p>That is, the dumb habit of thinking.</p>
<p>Thinking is obviously a loose term, however I suppose it means &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; in the traditional sense - using your brain to achieve something logically.</p>
<p>You could be thinking about why your partner left you, judging that guy on the train for being super ugly, or even reasoning with the narrative of a book you may or may not be reading.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all just&hellip; thinking.</p>
<p>In particular, I was fixated on this notion that you could overcome anything in life by thoroughly thinking it through.</p>
<p>Mum being a total bitch?</p>
<p>Oh right, I&rsquo;m going to get in a really shitty mood and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to get me through it, because my brain is telling me yes and that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Bla-zam! The kid&rsquo;s moved on.</p>
<p>Of course, I never said my thought processes as a child were particularly complex, nor reasonable.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter, because you know what? As a kid it sort of worked.</p>
<p>Your insecurities were basic at best. Your emotions worked largely as you wanted them to, not to mention, produced results.</p>
<p>Even emotional and physical abuse was somewhat manageable as a child.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like you know any better and even if you are aware, it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that you&rsquo;re still a helpless, defenseless kid.</p>
<p>The abuse becomes part of your &ldquo;well, this is life and feeling sad and being in denial is probably a reasonable coping mechanism, so I&rsquo;m going to stick with it, not realising it&rsquo;s actually fucking me up&rdquo; life experience.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re a kid and you can get away with this shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not healthy, but it&rsquo;s not like society depends on your ability to funciton mentally at the age of 11.</p>
<p>The main issue with this approach however is that it doesn&rsquo;t scale as you become older.</p>
<p>The irrational emotional attachments you trusted your brain with can begin impact this thing called &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; within your life.</p>
<p>Your shitty behaviours can begin to impact on your ability to grow and learn.</p>
<p>Getting angry or responding with judgement no longer solves your issues of debt or joblessness.</p>
<p>All these things weigh upon your ability to function reasonably, and in response, we will usually continue being in denial and become a cry-baby of pain and depression.</p>
<p>Oh, and let&rsquo;s not forget the wonderful world of drugs and heartbreak.</p>
<p>Try thinking your way out of that bullshit.</p>
<p>I mean, you hate her, but you also want to fuck her, and your stupid fucking brain can&rsquo;t decide what&rsquo;s less reasonable.</p>
<p>The key issue for many of us is that we failed to develop more &ldquo;appropiate&rdquo; coping mechanisms to our problems.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do something about it.</p>
<p>Or rather, I write about it and you read about it and you probably do nothing about it, because these are just words, and that&rsquo;s cool too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we can figure something out.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-how-we-abuse-it">Thinking: How We Abuse It</h3>
<p><img src="/img/blog/04-01.png" alt="How We Abuse Our Thinking"></p>
<p>I suppose there are two main culprits when it comes to those who abuse thinking.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are those who give up completely - people who accept the fact that everything is fucked up and that there&rsquo;s no point trying to fight their brain to work.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of people who not only wallow, but degredate.</p>
<p>The type of people who end up eating store-bought lasanga for dinner everyday, because #lifechoices.</p>
<p>It is abuse by not thinking, or rather choosing not to think to potentially help themselves.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there are the fighters - people who will insistently fight their brain, almost always resulting in further mental illness.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t be confused by the positive connotation. Fighters are no better than wallowers.</p>
<p>These are the types of people who become incredibly self-critical, who develop judgemental mindsets and are fragile at the core.</p>
<p>Rather than &ldquo;let go&rdquo; of the pain, fighters will continue to rationalise and compartamentalise the world, boxing themselves in like rats in a cage.</p>
<p>It is abuse by over-thinking.</p>
<p>Although, there is also a third category:</p>
<p>Those who figure out that there&rsquo;s a balance between these two extremes.</p>
<p>Those who understand that there is merit in not thinking, as well as thinking in moderation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not there yet, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>We just need to work at it.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we need to understand why our existing approach may be &ldquo;unbalanced&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To begin with, there is a massive misconception in society that thinking is some kind of productive idealisation of idea generation and intelligence.</p>
<p>And hell, with society&rsquo;s current obsession with maximising productivity, it&rsquo;s no wonder we&rsquo;re all so fucked.</p>
<p>Perhaps it has something to do with this concept of the so-called &ldquo;great thinkers&rdquo; of our time, as those who incessantly thought like human typewriters beating down at lightning speed on human progress.</p>
<p>Hate to blow your bubble, but it&rsquo;s all bullshit.</p>
<h3 id="the-three-pillars-of-thinking-abuse">The Three Pillars Of Thinking Abuse</h3>
<p><img src="/img/blog/04-02.png" alt="The Three Pillars Of Thinking Abuse"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought: Thinking itself is actually a burden.</p>
<p>It is a burden in the sense that it&rsquo;s a finite resource we have to expend, based on what little time and energy we have.</p>
<p>This is to say that the less thinking we can do, the better, because it means we can conserve our energy to achieve more in the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reason why self-critical and judegmental people, usually those obsessed with their insecurities, often feel battered or tired all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a massive abuse and waste of energy, to be able to function properly.</p>
<p>The truth is that most thought is purposeless and unproductive, in the sense that your energy is better spent not thinking in most scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, thinking about how you can change your appearance based on the assumption of what you believe others think about you is unproductive.</p>
<p>Also known keenly as insecurity, it serves no productive purpose. Not only is the problem trivial, however it&rsquo;s something that cannot deinitely be measured or solved.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m sure your own personal problems are much worse than &ldquo;worrying about what others think&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s an easy example to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Where we fail ourselves is by believing that all our thinking is actually genuinely trying to solve a problem.</p>
<p>And the way we get away with it is by passively thinking, rather than actively thinking.</p>
<p>The problem with relying solely on thinking as a tool is that when you repeat an action again and again for long enough, your brain will internal the process to no longer realise it&rsquo;s even doing that thing anymore.</p>
<p>It is how our actions turn into behaviours, eventually becoming hard-to-nudge habits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a phenomenon you&rsquo;re aware of, like when you take the same route each day.</p>
<p>Even though you&rsquo;ve gone to all this effort to get there, it can feel as if you&rsquo;ve somehow arrived at your destination seamlessly - as if your mind was somewhere else the whole time.</p>
<p>And this is largely how all &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; habits are developed.</p>
<p>We repeat these shitty behaviours frequently enough to the point of not realising that they&rsquo;re taking place.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is because we never learnt to question these thoughts.</p>
<p>This is understandable a child, because we simply didn&rsquo;t know any better and it becomes a learned behaviour into adulthood.</p>
<p>With all this said, we can expand upon what has been written and identify some specific ways we abuse thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We think in excess (worry, anxiety)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We think without genuine purpose (rumination, OCD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We think when we shouldn&rsquo;t (ignorance)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Later we will come back to these categories and explore how thinking can be used to positive effect - so we don&rsquo;t end up grabbing for another lasange in the freeze-food isle.</p>
<p>For now however, let&rsquo;s take a detour into how we may have gotten ourselves into this mess.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-thinking-abuse-begins">How The Thinking Abuse Begins</h3>
<p><img src="/img/blog/04-03.png" alt="How The Thinking Abuse Begins"></p>
<p>Arguably, most behaviours are developed as a result of childhood, which either progressively worsen or improve as a test to the foundations of our peers and parents.</p>
<p>Please take note that the following is anecdotal. Take and apply what you will.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I would describe myself as a fighter.</p>
<p>I will wrangle and wrangle and wrangle and exhaust myself to the point of collapse, no matter how much it harms me, followed by depression, followed by even more wrangling - in a seemingly endless cycle.</p>
<p>While there was often genuine thought involved, a large part of my thought comprised of self-criticism and judgement.</p>
<p>The reason was simple: I was constantly judged by my mother as a child and it is something I internalised and trained to do on my own.</p>
<p>Back-handed compliments were the norm.</p>
<p>It was never &ldquo;this is what you did well&rdquo; it was always &ldquo;this is what you could have done better&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It tendered me into a full-blooded cynic and it is a large part of reason why I&rsquo;m so fucked.</p>
<p>And unfortunately judgement is how most of us begin.</p>
<p>Because judgement, though seemingly benign, sort of works for its intended uses - and when you don&rsquo;t know better, you REALLY don&rsquo;t know better.</p>
<p>So you judge yourself, it makes you feel like shit, which prompts you to try harder in order to feel better.</p>
<p>As a child, all you see (and often care about) are the results.</p>
<p>Produce good results?</p>
<p>Well, it means mum doesn&rsquo;t remind you of what a completely worthless human being you are for another day, and that often overides the pain you self-create from trying to do something for the sake of pleasing someone else.</p>
<p>It causes you to validate this behaviour as something that is not only effective, but healthy.</p>
<p>Healthy because it produces results - not because of the resounding insecurity that is being developed behind the scenes.</p>
<p>What happens is that your life becomes this intrepid balancing act of foolishness, as you try to manipulate your own emotions to do even the most basic of tasks.</p>
<p>It is incredibly ineffective, and unfortunately for a lot of people, is all they know.</p>
<p>Then as you internalise this behaviour, it grows into what I like to call the &ldquo;judgemental mindset&rdquo; where you feel the need to judge everything.</p>
<p>Things not working out?</p>
<p>Well obviously, it&rsquo;s beause you&rsquo;re not judging enough.</p>
<p>And as you may tell, this simply spirals into judgement hell and is how many of us end up destroying ourselves through insecurity, depression, anxiety - as well as the rest of those abusive goodies.</p>
<p>In other words, we hit such a low through all the destruction and self-criticism that we finally recognise the need to try something different.</p>
<p>Some people never hit that low.</p>
<p>They hold onto their beliefs of judgement forever, sinking into the bitterness of self-righteousness and suffering.</p>
<p>How they manage to hold onto all that hate and criticism is beyond me, though in some cases understandable.</p>
<p>Another reason for my over-thinking can be attributed to my smug, self-righteous, aetheist beliefs as a child.</p>
<p>I was an instant skeptic from day one (maybe because of my treatment as child?) and in this sense, thinking and rationality were my religion.</p>
<p>As a religion, it meant idolising thinking as something perfect; a process that was completely impenetrable.</p>
<p>In my mind, thinking was always right, because in my eyes it was conveying truth, no matter how much pain and suffering it caused me.</p>
<p>As a result, I would never question the over-thinking or the depression as something harmful.</p>
<p>Rather, it validated my depression and hopeless because I saw no other alternatives. Not to mention, the self-fulfiling aspect of negative beliefs.</p>
<p>So basically, I was fucked from the get go.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay, because I&rsquo;ve at least managed to partially unfuck myself, which is better than what it used to be.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s move onto how we can unfuck ourselves, because I am absolutely in-love with the word unfuck.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-as-a-tool-for-good">Thinking As A Tool For Good</h3>
<p><img src="/img/blog/04-04.png" alt="Thinking As A Tool For Good"></p>
<p>In order to help us change, we need to start changing the way we think about thought.</p>
<p>Earlier I remarked on the idea that thought is a burden - it is an action that takes up a large amount of time and energy to implement.</p>
<p>In this sense, we need to start viewing thought as a tool - no different to a car or pencil.</p>
<p>A tool to help us solve a problem or achieve our goals. In the context of this website, a tool to help us achieve success in life.</p>
<p>Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>To do this we&rsquo;re going to focus on where thinking excels, as well as where it falls short in assisting us in our path towards success.</p>
<p>Thinking itself is an intensive, linear process.</p>
<p>This is to say that thinking works really well when we&rsquo;re trying to understand a limited number of sequential events - such as understanding mathematical logic, for example.</p>
<p>It works well with these things because it is limited in scope, allowing us to micro-manage and configure at an intimate level that promotes understanding.</p>
<p>It helps us develop small conclusions, which helps us construct a bigger picture of our domain.</p>
<p>This is what thinking does well at.</p>
<p>Where thinking really sucks is when it comes to a) Assessing something subjective, like our emotions or b) Attempting to assess something on a complex, or large time-scale.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because of the scope of the situation. Thinking is useful as a tool because it can help us come to verifiable conclusions.</p>
<p>When you approach something that is both extremely complex and subjective, this no longer becomes the case.</p>
<p>When there are too many possible answers, we can become overwhelmed and break down.</p>
<p>This is where we must develop other skills to help us handle these situations.</p>
<p>In other words, plan our thinking.</p>
<p>Planning is about recognising patterns and organising our thinking so it can be efficient, as well as view thing on a larger-scale.</p>
<p>While I won&rsquo;t go too in-depth into how to plan effectively, one basic strategy is to break things down into managable chunks, so we can think more effectively.</p>
<p>Of course, this also brings us to another important aspect of thinking to our advantage: Not thinking at all.</p>
<p>For example, when trying to understand subjective like the reason behind why someone broke up with us, thinking itself can serve no purpose - no matter how much we try to plan it out.</p>
<p>Instead, it can be much better to keep your mind calm and quiet, or on another level, engage in meditation.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s about finding the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>So to summarise, there are three different ways we can think about &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thinking (small scope)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planning (large scope)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meditation (not thinking)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With these three skills, we can more or less master our mind.</p>
<p>I intend to write a lot more about these topics within the future, however the aim of this article was to focus on thinking as a starting point. I&rsquo;ll have a seperate article for both planning and meditation.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-less-a-starting-point">Thinking Less: A Starting Point</h3>
<p><img src="/img/blog/04-05.png" alt="Thinking Less: A Starting Point"></p>
<p>In a sense, this article is merely a pre-cursor for guiding you towards a number of crucial skills which will help you become successful and think more efficiently.</p>
<p>At the very least, you are now a little more aware of the role thinking plays in your life, as well as the benefits it can provide.</p>
<p>Regardless, a good starting point is to simply think less.</p>
<p>You could be catching yourself in the middle of making a judgement, or simply realise that you&rsquo;re not thinking&hellip; when you&rsquo;re not thinking.</p>
<p>It is only through this kind of self-awareness can we better undesrtand our behaviours, and slowly change them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to the whole self-awareness thing, I get that it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re effectively activating a part of the brain you&rsquo;ve never used before, but I promise it&rsquo;s just a matter of time and practice.</p>
<p>Everyone is shitty in the beginning and even then, it took me years before I managed to hack it.</p>
<p>Acceptance sometimes helps - accepting that there is no point in making judgements and that it serves no purpose to my success in life.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my article! It means a lot to me :D</p>
