    <div class="content">
      

<p>I didn&rsquo;t grow up religious.</p>

<p>Well, I did.</p>

<p>But I certainly didn&rsquo;t grow up believing in any of it.</p>

<p>In particular, I never quite understood this compulsion for people to believe.</p>

<p>All I could comprehend was how silly their beliefs were, rather than understand the bigger picture of their religious experience.</p>

<p>Though perhaps that&rsquo;s what made it so dangerous.</p>

<p>While I knew of their beliefs, I didn&rsquo;t quite get to drink from that exquisite chalice that made them drunk.</p>

<p>And embrace myself in that feeling of religion.</p>

<p>Which in essence, made me more susceptible to being influenced by religion later on in life.</p>

<p>In all it&rsquo;s light and darkness.</p>

<p>And in a lot of ways, that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>

<p>I found myself being transformed by my beliefs and ideas more intensely later in life.</p>

<p>Disguised as something completely unfamiliar and ravishing.</p>

<p>On a personal level, substituting prophets with the woman in my life, almost recreating an agnostic version of the bible to complete my understanding of the world.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve thankfully dissolved all that, today I would like to write about why.</p>

<p>Because when you think about it, religion is everything.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s what defines our understanding of the world, as well as our behaviours and beliefs.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what we believe - we are all still confined to the hope and delusion which manifests from our undying curiosity to understand ourselves, and the world around us.</p>

<p>Where I believe people like myself go wrong, is believing too intensely in this idea of truth.</p>

<p>That one religion must inherently be better than another, based on the facts it aims to represent.</p>

<p>In my case, believing that my agnostic beliefs were superior above all.</p>

<p>When by definition, faith doesn&rsquo;t attempt to be anything more than a mere notion of hope and worship.</p>

<p>And in an ultimate twist of irony, find yourself becoming more religious than the people you criticised internally as being religious, in this holy search for &lsquo;truth&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Not as a means to discredit others.</p>

<p>But to reinforce what we believe about ourselves.</p>

<p>It is a perpetual cycle of tyranny.</p>

<p>Arguably, entirely unavoidable.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-temple">What Is A Temple?</h3>

<p><img src="/img/blog/19-01.png" alt="What Is A Temple?" /></p>

<p>To begin our understanding, I want us to focus on this idea of the temple.</p>

<p>And how it relates to every single one of us, regardless of our faith or lackthereof.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all aware, certain faiths construct churches to spread and congregate their faith.</p>

<p>And in a sense, we all do the same thing in our minds in regards to our ideas and beliefs.</p>

<p>We worship them, as well as glorify (or demonise) them.</p>

<p>And on a very basic level temples are places of worship.</p>

<p>They are places for us to cherish and embrace the ideas which we hold to be sacred.</p>

<p>In other words, they are places for us to cultivate and develop our beliefs.</p>

<p>And when you think of the mind as a structure, we all have thousands of different temples.</p>

<p>Representing different ideas and beliefs.</p>

<p>Each one of them, a reflection of our understanding of what we find important in life.</p>

<p>Some of these temples are quite large and influential.</p>

<p>Others are quite small and insignificant, meaning they have less influence on our behaviours and actions.</p>

<p>Many on the other hand simply don&rsquo;t exist, because we have yet to have that idea or belief.</p>

<p>For example, our seemingly non-existent temple on 3rd century peanut farming.</p>

<p>It probably just&hellip; won&rsquo;t ever happen.</p>

<p>The size (and existence) of our temple depends on how much time and effort we spend cultivating and embracing them.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my second point.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s important to note is that these temples aren&rsquo;t pre-existing structures.</p>

<p>And that beliefs don&rsquo;t just appear out of thin air.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re constructed.</p>

<p>We construct these temples.</p>

<p>We construct and reinforce them with our thoughts, our time and our worship.</p>

<p>We reinforce them each time we feel a sense of insecurity, and in every blink that subconsciously defines our experience.</p>

<p>We develop them and support them, not only with our words, however also with the thousands of other beliefs we have in our minds.</p>

<p>They are an extension of us in every single way.</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>Many of these beliefs may have been created out of our control as a child.</p>

<p>However that is not to say that we ultimately do not have responsibility, nor function over them.</p>

<h3 id="worshiping-the-wrong-temple">Worshiping The Wrong Temple</h3>

<p><img src="/img/blog/19-02.png" alt="Worshiping The Wrong Temple" /></p>

<p>Certainly, not understanding these ideas surrounding our beliefs.</p>

<p>Is where a lot of people go wrong with their mental health.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s learn and hopefully change.</p>

<p>It is important to understand how we construct (and worship) these temples in our mind.</p>

<p>Because they can explain a lot about the behaviours and irrational thoughts we exhibit on a daily basis.</p>

<p>In addition, once we master this process.</p>

<p>We can control what we believe, as well as how we feel about ourselves.</p>

<p>So why do people struggle so much in this regard?</p>

<p>Often, this is by design.</p>

<p>Something we&rsquo;ll get into in this article.</p>

<p>I suppose the aim of this article is to help you better understand how we create these temples of belief.</p>

<p>As well as how we can dismantle them.</p>

<p>Ultimately like all things in life, the medium isn&rsquo;t the problem.</p>

<p>Temples can be empowering, just as they can be destructive.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s important is our ability to control them, and construct and deconstruct them at our will.</p>

<p>Which like all things, is something you learn with time - no different to creating harmful beliefs.</p>

<p>And like most things in life, is something most of us won&rsquo;t get around to until completely necessary.</p>

<p>i.e. construct a temple that ruins our life.</p>

<p>For example, many of us construct temples which aim to set false expectations of reality, or which dictate our self-worth.</p>

<p>Temples based on relationships that aren&rsquo;t what they seem, or on paradigms of addiction which merely hold us ransom to our senses.</p>

<p>Personally speaking, I&rsquo;d constructed this incredible temple based on the experience of my first relationship.</p>

<p>Which by design, was greater than anything else I&rsquo;d ever constructed (welcome to the land of love).</p>

<p>And once that relationship had ended, I didn&rsquo;t quite know how to respond.</p>

<p>My feelings of leaving were conflicting with this temple/belief I&rsquo;d constructed in my mind, which represented our relationship as the greatest thing ever devised.</p>

<p>To the point that I&rsquo;d considered my temple to be a source of truth, preventing me to let go of her.</p>

<p>Even though I knew I wasn&rsquo;t actually happy in that relationship, and that it was toxic to me.</p>

<p>Inspite of the fact that she was no longer there in my life.</p>

<p>I simply couldn&rsquo;t understand that this temple was merely a fabrication in my mind.</p>

<p>Which is what makes our beliefs so powerful - they&rsquo;re essentially what define our reality.</p>

<p>Which is also to say that humans are inherently religious creatures.</p>

<p>Ultimately, leading us towards these states of delusion and denial, in an attempt to cope with the conflict we have between &lsquo;reality&rsquo; and our beliefs.</p>

<p>It is why the process of deconstructing these temples can feel as if we are destroying an inherent part of ourselves.</p>

<p>As if we are losing part of our reality.</p>

<p>Because we are essentially destroying the structure that we spent so long supporting.</p>

<p>And is the reason why most people never move on, because they find that pain too difficult to bear.</p>

<p>For the same reason we are all afraid of death.</p>

<p>Which is funny, because none of it is &lsquo;real&rsquo; and the pain is merely pre-conceived.</p>

<p>Except it&rsquo;s not funny.</p>

<p>This is life.</p>

<h3 id="temples-are-tough-business">Temples Are Tough Business</h3>

<p><img src="/img/blog/19-03.png" alt="Temples Are Tough Business" /></p>

<p>Temples are hard.</p>

<p>But they&rsquo;re not impossible.</p>

<p>The first thing we must understand about temples/beliefs is that we have complete control over them.</p>

<p>The problem most of us face is that most of us design these temples (usually subconsiously) solely to be worshipped.</p>

<p>Not to be destroyed.</p>

<p>We design them to be one-way negotiations in an attempt to cultivate delusion, rather than something we can truly connect with.</p>

<p>The scary thing about these kinds of temples, is that we often don&rsquo;t even realise we&rsquo;ve created them.</p>

<p>We enjoy the feeling of worshipping these temples so much, that we completely neglect the process that went into constructing them in the first place.</p>

<p>In fact, we become so desperate that design these these temples with all kinds of traps and defenses in order to ensure that they cannot be destroyed.</p>

<p>Making us feel utterly clueless as to how we should respond, once we realise how destructive they have become to our lives.</p>

<p>This is the monster we must address.</p>

<p>Naturally, in building our temples, we created guards and defense measures to ensure it&rsquo;s safety.</p>

<p>Which is almost inherent, given people usually build temples in times of need and desperation.</p>

<p>In essence, I suppose what I&rsquo;m getting at is that there are different ways we can construct our temples.</p>

<p>And that ideally, these temples should be places of understanding and change.</p>

<p>Not of dictatorship and delusion.</p>

<p>Structures not designed to replicate &lsquo;truth&rsquo;.</p>

<p>But designed to be a a reflection of the processes and behaviours in our life, rather than on faith or beliefs.</p>

<p>While beliefs are important - they don&rsquo;t necessarily facilitate anything to the extent that processes and routines do.</p>

<!-- Article about routine -->

<p>Of course, you could also argue that we shouldn&rsquo;t glorify our beliefs at all.</p>

<p>And while I would heartily agree, I would also argue that for most people in modern society, it&rsquo;s entirely unavoidable.</p>

<p>So at the very least, you may as well construct something benign, or that facilitates your goals and achievements in life.</p>

<p>Because when we invest in our temple, we invest in the behaviours and feelings that our temples promote.</p>

<p>And this is what gives us the power of control.</p>

<p>In dismantling our temples on the other hand, what we are truly saying is that we want to return that power to ourselves.</p>

<p>To return to a state where we don&rsquo;t feel obligated to believe in one particular idea or thing.</p>

<p>But to be free.</p>

<h3 id="dissolving-our-temples-and-constructing-new">Dissolving Our Temples And Constructing New</h3>

<p><img src="/img/blog/19-04.png" alt="Dissolving Our Temples And Constructing New" /></p>

<p>When we believe in something so intensely, we can fail to understand how exactly we&rsquo;re reinforcing these structures.</p>

<p>Not only because we&rsquo;re in denial, but because these temples have been designed not to be dismantled, let alone understood.</p>

<p>And for better or worse, it is a process that can take years.</p>

<p>Literally, years.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a method that can help us bypass all this
(although it will still probably take us years, however it is also much easier to navigation through)</p>

<p>Where we won&rsquo;t need to worry about dismantling these indestructible temples.</p>

<p>Precisely, we are going to reverse engineer the process and learn to create new temples.</p>

<p>Here is how.</p>

<p>You know that resistance you feel when you try to learn something new and unfamiliar?</p>

<p>Well, the reason why we find it so difficult, is because we&rsquo;re essentially constructing the beginnings of a new temple.</p>

<p>The reason why it&rsquo;s difficult is for a few reasons.</p>

<p>For starters, many of us go in learning something with no plans or designs of what the end result should be.</p>

<p>And even if we do, that is not to say that we have an idea of what our temple will look like.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re going to hate this temple (for example, I dislike my temple for sports trivia) or even if we&rsquo;re going to be able to build it at all.</p>

<p>So often we just blindly do something until it sticks.</p>

<p>This is why I stated earlier that it&rsquo;s much more constructive to build temples based on processes, rather than beliefs.</p>

<p>Because these temples can help us facilitate in the construction of other temples, based directly on our behaviours - rather than something more abstract.</p>

<p>In essence, we don&rsquo;t need to directly dismantle our harmful temples.</p>

<p>All we need to do is invest in creating new, more powerful temples - and naturally our harmful temples will dissolve as we place less attention and focus on them.</p>

<p>This means a few things.</p>

<p>Firstly, it means becoming comfortable with that unfamiliarity and uncertain that comes with temple building.</p>

<p>Because guess what.</p>

<p>Learning new things is always awkward and hard, but the smart ones learn to embrace that.</p>

<p>Secondly, it means finding new processes and beliefs.</p>

<p>And honestly, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what they are.</p>

<p>Because the only thing we&rsquo;re interested in is the process of learning, rather than what we&rsquo;re learning.</p>

<p>Which can only come from from hard work, imagination and ambition - things which temples do not provide.</p>

<p>Anything that empowers you to want to become a better person.</p>

<p>Often where people will go wrong is that they will overcome their addiction, only to realise they have nothing else to go to.</p>

<p>Merely repeating the cycle and returning to their bad habits.</p>

<p>In these cases, it is because these new temples haven&rsquo;t been created from hard work, so their foundation will collapse at their very knees.</p>

<h3 id="master-your-temple">Master Your Temple</h3>

<p><img src="/img/blog/19-05.png" alt="Master Your Temple" /></p>

<p>There is a second aspect to this that I haven&rsquo;t quite covered.</p>

<p>And that is the aspect of worship.</p>

<p>Specifically, in understanding how we create these temples, we want to focus on how we worship our beliefs and ideas.</p>

<p>To identify them, and merely observe how we interact with our beliefs.</p>

<p>Is it positive? Is it harmful?</p>

<p>These are questions we must address in understanding how we interact with the world around us.</p>

<p>Certainly, I am of the belief that experiencing (and perhaps overcoming) religion is an unavoidable aspect of the human experience.</p>

<p>Largely, because it&rsquo;s something you first need to experience in order to identify.</p>

<p>And yet once you&rsquo;ve identified it, you then have to face the crushing experience of dissolving it and everything else along with it.</p>

<p>In an ideal world we should not rely or construct on our temples at all.</p>

<p>And certainly, living without notion or expectation or overwhelming blief is something a lot of us should strive towards.</p>

<p>Yet at the same time, it forms such a strong part of the human identity that perhaps it is asking too much of us.</p>

<p>Ultimately, as long as you have the ability to control your temples.</p>

<p>Rather than have them control you.</p>

<p>Can we also have control over the success we create on a daily basis.</p>

<!-- 

Of course, most of us don't have this kind of luxury in the modern world - which means the strategic use of temples is the next best thing. 

Which is to say that we shouldn't create temples based in overwhelming belief. 

Or necessarily even commit to any beliefs at all. 

Certainly, temples that empower us have their place in life. 


This is often why I spout the merits of routine, because it can help us solidify the process of building helpful temples. 

Through that initial temple you build from embracing routine itself. 


First, we want to find ways in which we can distance ourselves from our temples. 

This usually means not taking our feelings, emotions and thoughts personally.

In essence, this means understanding that while these things feel real, they are merely indicators.

Rather than a source of truth as our mind is trying to tell us. 

-- link to our emotions are an elaborate lie --



The other good news is that it doesn't have to happen overnight.

Each time you chip away or think less about your temple than the day before, is one step closer .

Often it's not about making big agreements.

By making many small agreements we can slowly dissolve many of the negative aspects in our life. 

More simply, first we have actions, then we form habits, which ultimately become beliefs.


A temple based in hard work and kindness.  

Or at the very least, not hating yourself or feeling worthless about yourself. 

It could be an ambition, or something you want to aciheve. 

This part is crucial, because it's transfering our time and energy into developing something more positive.


Secondly, we also want to at the same time, to construct a much more forgiving and healthy temple for us to worship. 


It doesn't matter what religion people believe in.

Quite frankly, I don't even think religion itself gives a shit.

What matters is understanding this idea of faith. 

And how it moulds into our interpretation of reality, as well as our understanding the world around us. 

As a medium through which we all attempt to understand the world. 

Because religion has very little to do with organised faith.

Instead, religion is defined by our beliefs - something every single one of us have in common.

The trick is in seperating religion from the common widespread institutions which try to 'claim' it.

Because a lot of us can get caught up in anger created from identifying other people's beliefs. 

When it completely misses the mark on understanding our own spirituality. 

Regardless of what we believe, we all still relate to our beliefs in the same way. 




This also explains why it can be difficult to construct new temples.

For example, when we start a new routine or perhaps even a new hobby.

It's because there is no pre-existing temple, and so it's like building a foundation from scratch. 

Instead, it needs to come from other means.
