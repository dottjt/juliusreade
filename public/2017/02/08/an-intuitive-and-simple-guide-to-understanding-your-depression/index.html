    <div class="content">
      <p>The aim of this article is to help you come to terms with your depression.</p>
<p>Ummmm, say what?</p>
<p>Don’t fret, you lucky puck.</p>
<p>I promise it won&rsquo;t involve intense emotional gouging, followed by hours of soul-destroying questioning of your precious most-inner thoughts.</p>
<p>Except that it probably will, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, depression is a heavy topic with a lot of thorny edges poking at the sides.</p>
<p>Which is why this article won&rsquo;t focus on a number of topics that are vital to understanding depression.</p>
<p>Such as how to commit towards recovering, creating motivation, delegating positive agreements, blah blah.</p>
<p>Those are topics that I will cover in seperate articles, if only because my fingers are limited to how much they can write.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Instead, what this article will primarily focus on is presenting you with a simple framework which will allow you to better understand your depression.</p>
<p>An effective framework for you to learn and build upon, which will enable you to obtain a very basic and micro point of view of your depression.</p>
<p>&hellip;which in my opinion, is an excellent starting point for those serious about tackling their mental health.</p>
<p>Of course, please understand that it&rsquo;s a method that cannot stand on it&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>It requires significant additional context in order to be effective, which I will eventually write about, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>All I can say for now, as I prepare my fingers for the delicious text ahead, is that if you stick with it, you&rsquo;ll eventually be able to stop feeling depressed altogether.</p>
<p>Which is pretty cool. Maybe even sexy.</p>
<p>Though baby steps, yeah?</p>
<p>It’s hard enough when you can barely wake up in the morning, so I&rsquo;m not asking you to go out and eliminate poverty.</p>
<p>Not to mention, it takes years.</p>
<p>No different to becoming fluent at anything else in life, whether it be a language or a sport.</p>
<p>While depression may not an easy topic to grasp, I believe this is a reflection of the lack of intuitive explanations currently available on the internet.</p>
<p>Put simply, my job is trick your brain into believing I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>&hellip;based on how I managed to trick myself into believing there&rsquo;s merit in being a functional human being.</p>
<p>Which I&rsquo;m sure you crave on some very primal level, or otherwise would not be reading this article.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s begin.</p>
<h3 id="asking-the-wrong-questions">Asking The Wrong Questions</h3>
<p><img src="/img/blog/08-01.png" alt="Asking The Wrong Questions"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Chances are you&rsquo;ve partaken in the hilarious dynamic of having another person comment, or perhaps enquire into why you look like a complete emotional wreck.</p>
<p>« So Julius, ummm… y u so sad? y u sadie tear eyes? »</p>
<p>&hellip;and in the immediate struggle that ensues, you contemplate explaining some horrible fact about your life (which of course, you&rsquo;re currently trying to suppress).</p>
<p>Or explain why they&rsquo;re actually an asshole, because it&rsquo;s none of their business and please, if you could just back off, that would be wonderful.</p>
<p>Instead, you prompt to mutter an elementary &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; and next thing you know, you&rsquo;ve escaped into the nearest closet to avoid any further confrontation.</p>
<p>Yet despite how much it annoys us when others question our feelings, it&rsquo;s a conversation we continue to pursue within our own head when we&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>You know, as if we&rsquo;re somehow more qualified than the person next to us.</p>
<p>So we sit there, usually alone, and we think.</p>
<p>We pick apart every single detail in our head, searching for an answer that we feel entirely incapable, nor prepared of answering.</p>
<p>And yet despite how hopeless it makes us feel, we also feel as if we have no choice but to pursue the emotional and intellectual grind.</p>
<p>All because we&rsquo;ve created and committed to this stupid agreement in our head that we&rsquo;re the only ones capable of helping ourselves.</p>
<p>Commonly known as rumination, it doesn&rsquo;t work, it doesn&rsquo;t provide any meaningful insight into our depression and it&rsquo;s a complete disaster that causes us to collapse further into our jelly-like state.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to understand why.</p>
<p>A lot of people tend to view rumination as a form of trying, which they equate with effort, which they further equate with solving problems.</p>
<p>Which makes sense logically in our head, but fails to deliver due to the fallacy that effort scales to producing valid outcomes i.e. solutions to our depression.</p>
<p>I mean, if it were truly that simple, no one would have any problems.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn&rsquo;t to say that we shouldn&rsquo;t question our thoughts or feelings.</p>
<p>It merely emphasises <strong>the importance of asking the right questions</strong>, as opposed to misleading questions, which naturally lead to misleading answers, which serve only to strengthen our depression and mental illness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, and the reason why rumination doesn&rsquo;t work, is that our depression causes us to ask the wrong questions by design.</p>
<p>It skews our focus inwards and towards ourselves, rather than on the big picture of our life and our depression.</p>
<p>Which primarily leads to asking the question of why.</p>
<p>Why we feel depressed.</p>
<p>Why we hate ourselves.</p>
<p>Why our life sucks.</p>
<p>Why we can&rsquo;t seem to get laid, despite our rigid good looks and exquisitely sexy eyebrows.</p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, these questions have been misleading us all along.</p>
<h3 id="constructing-a-coherent-narrative">Constructing A Coherent Narrative</h3>
<p><img src="/img/blog/08-02.png" alt="Constructing A Coherent Narrative"></p>
<p>Part of the problem with asking the question of &lsquo;why&rsquo; is that it fails to provide us with a cohesive narrative for us to make sense of.</p>
<p>Narrative is important because it&rsquo;s what allows us to connect with our thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>In essence, creating clarity in our lives and allowing us to develop hope, motivation and ambition.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Part of the problem in asking the question of why in the context of this narrative, is that there are thousands of potential reasons why.</p>
<p>&hellip;which we try to piece together into some coherent narrative, which inevitably ends up as this glob of irrational baloney.</p>
<p>You know, because she hates me, because she&rsquo;s too afraid to love me, because she doesn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s talking about, because she&rsquo;s lying, because she&rsquo;s crazy, because she&rsquo;s pretending not to care, because she&rsquo;s in denial, because she&rsquo;s on drugs, because she doesn&rsquo;t know how to communicate her feelings, because she&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>And then when you take into account our own feelings and emotions, you&rsquo;re basically left with a pile of burnt fairy dust.</p>
<p>Emotional splatter.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we end up creating narratives which conclude that we are hopeless, and that we are entirely incapable as human beings.</p>
<p>Hopeless by design, because of the kinds of misleading questions our depression begs of us to ask.</p>
<p>Which extends to developing shitty, somewhat retarded narratives that make no sense.</p>
<p>Yet the funny thing is that I think part of us knows that our narratives suck, and yet because we&rsquo;re so desperate, we feel as if we have no choice but to continue to constuct and tinker.</p>
<p>In a sense, building this god complex within ourselves, which I believe develops into obsession and narcissism.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a better way.</p>
<p>Instead, I am going to introduce you to a different way of thinking about your depression, that fundamentally changes the types of questions we ask ourselves.</p>
<p>A method which approaches depression with a plot in mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple, whole new way of understanding our depression, that doesn&rsquo;t trap us into these meaningless cycles.</p>
<h3 id="how">How</h3>
<p><img src="/img/blog/08-03.png" alt="How"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>Instead of asking why we’re depressed, we&rsquo;re instead going to ask <strong>how we get depressed</strong>.</p>
<p>Why we get depressed?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>How we get depressed?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>While it may seem like an insignificant change in thinking, asking questions from this point of view radically changes not only our definition of what depression is, but also how we can relate to our own emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly incredible once you understand why:</p>
<p>Humans are inherently curious creatures, driven to explore and endlessly question the world around us, in an attempt to uncover, improve and satisfy our own lives&hellip;</p>
<p>*Insert Epic Monologue*</p>
<p>&hellip;yet despite the vast knowledge we have of the world and the universe at large, we still have no idea why things are the way they are.</p>
<p>We don’t understand why the universe began, why the speed of light travels at a constant, why we can&rsquo;t achieve equality, amongst the millions of other questions our species has pondered.</p>
<p>Largely as it turns out, because none of these questions matter.</p>
<p>Because what truly matters is the question of how.</p>
<p>Only by understanding how something works, can we manage to apply it to our lives.</p>
<p>For example, we don’t need to know why gravity is a fundamental force of nature, in order to know that if we jump from the top of a tall tree, that we&rsquo;re probably going to be in for a bad time.</p>
<p>Put another way, the why isn’t important because it doesn&rsquo;t provide us with insight into how something functions.</p>
<p>&hellip;or perhaps from a different angle, you could say that we must first understand how something works, before we can understand why it works.</p>
<p>In order to do this for our own purposes, we must focus on the process, rather than the meaning behind the process.</p>
<p>That is to say, the process of depression.</p>
<p>(In fact, everything is a process, and can be broken down into a series of processes.)</p>
<p>And once you understand this, completely changes the way you think about depression.</p>
<p>Oh, and you know the best thing about processes?</p>
<p>Processes are entirely predictable.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>You bet your ass they are, and that&rsquo;s what makes them so damn powerful.</p>
<p>Remember, understanding why something happens does not provide us with insight to control it.</p>
<p>Only by understanding how something works can we affect the circumstances around us.</p>
<p>Which means, identifying the process of depression.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-common-processes">Identifying Common Processes</h3>
<p><img src="/img/blog/08-04.png" alt="Identifying Common Processes"></p>
<p>Okay, so now you’re convinced that depression can be understood from the point of view of a process.</p>
<p>Excellent!</p>
<p>Now give me all your money and sign up to my newsletter.</p>
<p>YAAAAAAYYYYYYYY.</p>
<p>Anyway, we continue.</p>
<p>Understanding any process is always gradual, no matter how large or small, is something that comes with experience, self-awareness and time.</p>
<p>Certainly, no one is expecting you or anyone else to immediately understand how everything in their life works.</p>
<p>We simply need to start small.</p>
<p>A process can be thought of is a series of events that have a beginning and an end.</p>
<p>Even more simply, they can be thought of a sequential breakdown of the events that occur in your life.</p>
<p>Even if you consider yourself a drunken mess of incomprehensible disorganisation, there are everyday processes which we can all identify.</p>
<p>We eat. We sleep. We think.</p>
<p>All processes we can empathise with.</p>
<p>Identifying these basic processes is often an excellent place to start and it&rsquo;s important to start small because it allows us to more easily identify larger processes.</p>
<p>Of course, listing these things (which seem blatantly obvious) is inevitably going to make you feel stupid.</p>
<p>However it&rsquo;s vital that we do start small and challenge this perception, for a number of dashingly responsible reasons.</p>
<p>To begin with, our feelings of pointlessness are largely based on our perception of what we know, rather than what we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In the context of this exercise, our feelings are based on the perceived value of time and effort.</p>
<p>If we hold the belief that effort equates to effectiveness, then naturally anything we approach without this rigorousness will seem pointless.</p>
<p>Instead, I am here to tell you that rigorousness is pointless and ineffective.</p>
<p>That part of the failure of rumination is this idea that depression can be overcome with effort, when in reality it is overcome with careful co-ordination and control.</p>
<p>Which in a lot of circumstances, means not thinking at all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by doing something simple, we can train our minds to think simply, and break the cycle of rumination many of us face.</p>
<p>And in the process train ourselves to disregard our expectations of what learning is, and to embace understanding as a process, no different to any other.</p>
<p>&hellip;without collapsing into a pit of anxiety, at the thought of sitting there and doing nothing.</p>
<p>An example of this is when I started learning undergraduate maths for the first time earlier last year.</p>
<p>In the beginning it was frustrating.</p>
<p>Despite how much effort I was putting in, I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t getting anywhere.</p>
<p>I was still stuck on what I percieved to be incredibly basic concepts, and it felt like I was incapable of learning the material.</p>
<p>What I failed to understand is that the process of learning maths is inherently slow, and that it&rsquo;s normal to spend weeks trying to solve one problem.</p>
<p>It was only once I truly embraced this fact, that I no longer wasted any time worrying about what I should have been achieving, and could instead focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>A huge part of understanding any process, is about learning to come to terms with our emotions.</p>
<p>Because what we&rsquo;re effectively doing is redeveloping our coping mechanisms, by changing the questions we ask ourselves.</p>
<p>Back to our original task, it can help to write down some basic things you do everyday.</p>
<p>Here’s what I can come up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up.</li>
<li>Take bus.</li>
<li>Work.</li>
<li>Eat lunch.</li>
<li>Resume work.</li>
<li>Take bus home.</li>
<li>Eat dinner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have a basic skeleton, take one of these processes and try to describe what happens.</p>
<p>For example, with waking up in the morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hear alarm.</li>
<li>Turn off alarm.</li>
<li>Cuddle girlfriend.</li>
<li>Get out of bed.</li>
<li>Put clothes on.</li>
<li>Put charged laptop into bag.</li>
<li>Pack lunch.</li>

<p>The point of these exercises is to help us become more aware of what goes on in our lives, which will eventually allow us to understand how these processes affect us.</p>
<p>While these observations are basic, once we become competent in identifying them we can then move onto describing our emotions relative to these tasks.</p>
<p>So we can become self-aware king, and dictate the way we live our lives.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog/08-05.png" alt="Identifying The Process Of Depression"></p>
<p>All it takes is a few minutes each day.</p>
<p>It really is a matter of practice, to build up the skill of identifying basic processes in our lives.</p>
<p>Though a course of warning:</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t as easy as it looks.</p>
<p>The reason why it&rsquo;s difficult is because it&rsquo;s an activity we need to consciously engage with, and depression makes this incredibly hard.</p>
<p>Hard because I&rsquo;m asking you to take control of your thoughts and emotions, to direct it towards something meaningful.</p>
<p>Hard because you have to refrain from all the negative thoughts in your head, in order to focus and ask the question of &ldquo;What process am I engaging in right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a sense, identifying these processes can be thought of a process of meditation.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s literally what this entire article has secretly been about:</p>
<p>Introducing you to a form of meditation without all the new age crap, so you wouldn&rsquo;t freak out and run away.</p>
<p>You could be at the cafe. In the shower. In the car.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself:</p>
<p><strong>What process am I currently engaging in?</strong></p>
<p>Then once you feel comfortable enough, ask yourself:</p>
<p><strong>How does it make me feel?</strong></p>
<p>Only through engaging this conscious questions can we eventually understand ourselves, in particular, our depression.</p>
<p>Of course, there is one glaring issue that I need to raise.</p>
<p>While following this method can help you understand your depression and how it arises, it cannot however prevent you from engaging in behaviours that make you feel depressed.</p>
<p>Such as finding the courage to remove toxic people from your life.</p>
<p>In most cases however, having any amount of understanding is usually enough to motivate people to change.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I cannot think of a non-violent, nor ethical way to help.</p>
<p>In other cases, you may simply lack the domain knowledge to be able to understand the process at hand, in which case professionals can readily close the gap.</p>
<p>This is particularly true if your depression is caused by diet or nutrition (as is often the case) and you don’t quite understand how eating junk food and getting five hours of sleep a night is bad for your mood.</p>
<p>Again I emphasise this heavily: Knowing that junk food is bad and being able to clearly put into words how junk food affects your mood as a process, are two completely different things.</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<p>A certifiable method to help you understand your depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 31 degrees right now and I&rsquo;m fucking exhausted.</p>
