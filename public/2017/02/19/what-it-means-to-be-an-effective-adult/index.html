What adult do you want to become?

How to adult effectively. 
-->

<p>Millenials like myself are retarded.</p>

<p>We have all these false expectations of what life should be, and in believing so strongly in the advice that has been thrown at us, have failed miserably to cope with the harsh reality of&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;not becoming the next big thing on YouTube.</p>

<p>Yep. That&rsquo;s me.</p>

<p>Despite being &lsquo;adults&rsquo; many of us fear commitment, rely too heavily on our parents for financial support, or fail to kickstart our careers in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Which is to say that many of us struggle to adult.</p>

<p>You know, that thing we have apparently are, though cannot quite identify with.</p>

<p>Yep. That&rsquo;s us.</p>

<p>Part of the reason why we struggle is that we falsely believe adulthood will entail some kind of dramatic shift in attitude and perspective.</p>

<p>As if to be wisked off our feet and towards a stable family and six-figure income.</p>

<p>A shift which never actually takes place.</p>

<p>Instead, we simply wake up one year older, completely oblivious to world around us and our lives continue almost unscathed.</p>

<p>As a result, we fail to treat our lives with urgency and instead of embracing commitment, responsibility and hard work, we instead continue to be broken adults.</p>

<p>A far cry from all the admirable traits we ideally should be transfering over to future generations.</p>

<p>You know, like the children we expect to have in our 40s, even though the <a href="http://www.babycenter.com.au/a1013991/getting-pregnant-in-your-40s">chance of conceiving at 40 is around 20%</a>, falling to less than 5% by your mid-40s.</p>

<p>Our false millenial ideals of &ldquo;live now and settle later&rdquo; simply don&rsquo;t add up.</p>

<p>Which is ultimately to say that there are very real consequences of not playing The Adult.</p>

<p>Because when it comes down to it, society functions on the basis of adulthood and if you don&rsquo;t put in the time and effort, you&rsquo;re gonna get crushed.</p>

<p>Of course, excessive pessimism doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>What I mean to say is that life can be incredibly comfortable and enjoyable later on, if you dedicate some of your 20s towards commitment and responsibility.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you going to be unhealthy. You&rsquo;re going to be mentally unprepared and let depression get the best of you, when life becomes even harder. You&rsquo;re going to be broke and without assets. You won&rsquo;t have the strength to maintain a loving relationship.</p>

<p>Though the truth is even more vital:</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not going to feel depressed and hopeless NOW if you commit to your adulthood.</p>

<p>So today, we&rsquo;re going to focus on the positive, enabling attributes of being an adult, that will essentially allow us to have our cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>In other words, to strive for a balance in life so we can play the role of the adult, as well as afford the inherent retardation that is being a millenial.</p>

<p>Cause we silly.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-effective-adulthood">What Is Effective Adulthood?</h3>

<p><img src="/img/blog/09-02.png" alt="What Is Effective Adulthood?" /></p>

<p>Obviously, there&rsquo;s no one way to adult.</p>

<p>Some of us choose to earn our living solving life&rsquo;s most pressing issues, while others of us are still in a frenzy of cluelessness, as we extend our hand towards the bong for our ritual wake n&rsquo; bake.</p>

<p>Adults are only human.</p>

<p>However since we&rsquo;re striving to become successful adults, not dysfunctional ones, we&rsquo;ll need to dive into the enabling traits that will help us become most effective.</p>

<p>Which when you boil down to it is quite simple:</p>

<p><strong>The only two things you need in life in order to become a successful adult are skills and attitude.</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s honestly that simple.</p>

<p>&hellip;simple enough that we overthink it and completely fuck it up.</p>

<p>To deliver you this well-timed spiel, without useful skills you&rsquo;re basically deemed worthless by society, since you cannot contribute to the functioning of society.</p>

<p>And when you cannot contribute to society, you have zero opportunity to exert any amount of influence, leverage or attention within your own sphere of influence.</p>

<p>That is unless if you&rsquo;re exceeding attractive or funny (which are essentially skills within themselves) - which brings us to our second point.</p>

<p>Your skills, or perhaps your amazingly gorgeous face or your stunning wit, is useless without the right attitude.</p>

<p>Attitude is what essentially allows us to use our skills appropriately, and to leverage them to the best of our ability.</p>

<p>For example you could be the most talented painter in the whole wide world, however if you don&rsquo;t have the right attitude to sell yourself - no one is going to discover your works.</p>

<p>In addition, attitude is what allows us to commit to our skills, so that we can improve upon them and not get distracted by &lt;Insert Mental Illness Here&gt;.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, with the right attitude and the right skills, you can do and achieve almost anything in life.</p>

<p>The issue is that most people will very rarely have a healthy balance of skill and attitude.</p>

<p>Hence why we are &lsquo;unadjusted&rsquo;.</p>

<p>In a lot of cases, our failure to adult can extend from an arrogance or ignorance in our attitude, and this is often what gets in the way of our success.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is a) We don&rsquo;t understand the urgency, nor importance of why we must commit to these skills b) We&rsquo;re unsure of what skills we should commit to and c) We&rsquo;re too inexperienced to be able to understand how to effectively utilise our skills.</p>

<p>This really is to say that our expectations of life, and of reality, are incompatible.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re deluded millenials, remember?</p>

<p>And so in the process of our retardation, our ambition turns into mental illness, we get taken advantage of by our bosses, and we end up even more cynical than previously before about life.</p>

<p>Because at the end of the day, we don&rsquo;t know if our skills are valid, nor can we truly understand whether our attitude is truly helpful.</p>

<p>Which is to say that we&rsquo;re completely clueless.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s a good thing, because it gives us a starting point for which to approach and tackle these issues.</p>

<p>We begin with attitude.</p>

<h3 id="developing-your-attitude-towards-life">Developing Your Attitude Towards Life</h3>

<p><img src="/img/blog/09-03.png" alt="Developing Your Attitude Towards Life" /></p>

<p>Our attitude towards life is almost always the limiting factor in most situations.</p>

<p>(There&rsquo;s a reason sales is a huge industry)</p>

<p>To assist us, we&rsquo;re going to set some healthy expectations so that you can spend a little less time guessing, and a little more time getting your shit together.</p>

<h4 id="honestly-we-re-all-clueless">Honestly, We&rsquo;re All Clueless</h4>

<p>Here is the first and most important rule of adulting:</p>

<p><strong>No one has a damn clue what they&rsquo;re doing.</strong></p>

<p>And by gosh do people take advantage of that.</p>

<p>Because at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all a game of confidence.</p>

<p>If you act with authority, people will listen to you.</p>

<p>If you say you can do something with conviction, they will believe you.</p>

<p>People barely know better.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the reason people get underpaid.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the reason people get bullied under conditions they believe are &lsquo;fair&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the reason people believe they&rsquo;re worthless.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the reason 90% of people lose money on the stock exchange.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t buy into other people&rsquo;s cluelessness and furthermore, don&rsquo;t buy into your own cluelessness.</p>

<p>Because always remember: They are no different to you.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t know anymore about life than you do. They simply believe it and know how to get others to believe it too.</p>

<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not to say that you shouldn&rsquo;t respect them and their schemes of influence.</p>

<p>The police, or even your boss, for example.</p>

<p>It simply means you should always be aware of your place in society, and what you have to do to be where you wish to be.</p>

<h4 id="take-risks">Take Risks</h4>

<p>In a world so clueless people, it utterly makes sense to take risks because your chances of succeeding are high.</p>

<p>You can get away with so much, whether it be theft or simply taking advantage of knowledge someone doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>An interesting quote in regards to the stock market that resonates with this idea:</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Everyone agrees on price, but disagrees on value&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>And when you think about it, that really is the great trickery of society - leading people to believe they are getting value, at a price which significantly suits you.</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t have to be sinister.</p>

<p>For example, if you believe the price of you spending four hours each day in your 20s towards improving your skills is worth the value it can deliver at 40, then you&rsquo;ve comfortably beat the market.</p>

<p>The reason most people don&rsquo;t succeed is because they over-estimate the consequence of taking risks.</p>

<p>They genuinely believe the cluelessness aka propaganda they&rsquo;ve been told and they buy into the fear that keeps them clueless.</p>

<p>The kind of people who end up working at the one place for five years at minimum wage, because they worry they have &lsquo;too little experience&rsquo; to find anything else.</p>

<p>Hilarious. Absolutely hilarious.</p>

<p>And certainly, a poor attitude towards life.</p>

<p>On a more fundamental level, it indicates something more serious:</p>

<p>A lack of faith in one&rsquo;s own ability to sell themselves.</p>

<p>Educate yourself and see risks for what they really are:</p>

<p><strong>Opportunities</strong>.</p>

<p>The opportunity to change and to defy your own self-doubt.</p>

<p>Because whether you believe it or not, you always have leverage.</p>

<p>Well, assuming you have skills, at the very least.</p>

<h4 id="work-won-t-always-suck">Work Won&rsquo;t Always Suck</h4>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I can tell you:</p>

<p><strong>Your first-few working years are probably going to suck</strong>.</p>

<p>Because ultimately when we&rsquo;re starting out, we have no real leverage to dictate our own terms and that&rsquo;s simply part of the game.</p>

<p>The good news is that you only need 1 - 2 years experience before you can start doing what you like.</p>

<p>Personally speaking I only made it 10 months in before I quit on what I would consider my first &ldquo;career-focused&rdquo; job, and that worked out wondering for me.</p>

<p>However there&rsquo;s one important detail that made it work:</p>

<p><strong>I was incredibly passionate about my skills, and I worked hard each day to improve them</strong>.</p>

<p>Because at the end of the day, being an adult is all about building leverage in your life.</p>

<p>Skills provide you with leverage, just as attitude can too.</p>

<p>Get through those first few shitty years and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

<h4 id="you-will-be-exhausted">You Will Be Exhausted</h4>

<p>Ultimately, adulthood comes down to effort and routine.</p>

<p>And if it&rsquo;s one thing us millenials hate more than anything, it&rsquo;s effort and routine.</p>

<p>Certainly the idea of working 9-to-5 sounds terrifying, and personally speaking it was a huge fear of mine.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t worry.</p>

<p>Because here&rsquo;s what I can tell you:</p>

<p><strong>Working full-time will make you a happier person</strong>.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because despite dedicating 38 hours each week towards work, you&rsquo;ll actually have more time and you&rsquo;ll be more motivated to spend your time where it truly counts.</p>

<p>Sounds crazy, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal: When you&rsquo;re just lazing around at home, there&rsquo;s no urgency to get anything done.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no incentive to wake up at 5:50am in the morning and study for the next 2 hours, because in your head you feel as if you have all the time in the world.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re working full-time however, you become ultra-aware of the time you do have, and it drives you to make the most of it.</p>

<p>However that&rsquo;s not even the main thing:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something about having limited time that makes you defy exhaustion.</p>

<p>Previously I would get exhausted after 40 minutes of study, but now it&rsquo;s like I can remain engaged for hours.</p>

<p>When you realise you only have 4 hours each day to study, you make sure those four hours are quality study time and your mind refuses to switch off.</p>

<p>I think part of the drive is in realising how awful entry-level positions are.</p>

<p>Which motivates you to want more.</p>

<p>I even wrote an entire article about, if you&rsquo;d like to know more:</p>

<div class="cross-post-template">

</div>

<p>You should totally read it.</p>

<h4 id="don-t-stop-don-t-overthink-it">Don&rsquo;t Stop. Don&rsquo;t Overthink It</h4>

<p>Inevitably there are times where you will no longer want to adult.</p>

<p>Where you&rsquo;ll be fed up with looking after yourself, cleaning the floors for the eighth time, or even dealing with people in general.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t stop.</p>

<p>Seriously, don&rsquo;t stop.</p>

<p>You only get one chance to adult, so do it right.</p>

<p>One the main reasons why people stop is that they overthink things.</p>

<p>They worry if they&rsquo;re not committing to the right thing or if they&rsquo;re happy or whatever thought du jour they&rsquo;re preoccupying themselves with.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a key piece of advice they don&rsquo;t tell you in school:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t think.</p>

<p>Seriously, it&rsquo;s a waste of time.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the crux of it: Productive people don&rsquo;t have time to think, because they&rsquo;re busy actually doing stuff.</p>

<p>The idea is better explained within this article:</p>

<div class="cross-post-template">
    <a class="cross-post-template-title" href="https://juliusreade.com/2016/12/11/smart-people-dont-think.-they-plan-ahead/">Smart People Don't Think. They Plan Ahead</a>
</div>

<p>Hopefully this list covers a few important points for you to grasp onto, at least as a starting point.</p>

<h3 id="committment-is-beautiful">Committment Is Beautiful</h3>

<p><img src="/img/blog/09-04.png" alt="Committment Is Beautiful" /></p>

<p>Committment is beautiful.</p>

<p>You know why?</p>

<p>Because most people are too afraid to commit and by committing, that already puts you ahead of 95% of most people.</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that there&rsquo;s this perception that by not committing, you&rsquo;re somehow experiencing more of the world.</p>

<p>And yet in reality, by not committing you simply achieve less over the long-run and never quite master anything.</p>

<p>Whether you commit towards your mental health, your career or even your relationship - you&rsquo;re honestly doing more than most people.</p>

<p>The other reason committment is important is that it opens up opportunity in life.</p>

<p>This is another concept that people can&rsquo;t quite seem to grasp: They believe by committing that they&rsquo;re actually locking themselves in, rather than enabling themselves to grow.</p>

<p>On the one hand, people want children, yet they freak out at the prospect of being in a relationship.</p>

<p>They let their fears get in the way of what they want, because that&rsquo;s all it is.</p>

<p>Irrationality rearing it&rsquo;s ugly head and making us indecisive adults.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s one rule you should follow, it&rsquo;s that you should always commit when given the chance.</p>

<p>What people don&rsquo;t realise is that you don&rsquo;t lose anything by committing.</p>

<p>People worry about losing choice, when in reality they haven&rsquo;t committed to anything.</p>

<h3 id="what-keeps-me-going">What Keeps Me Going</h3>

<p><img src="/img/blog/09-05.png" alt="What Keeps Me Going" /></p>

<p>Certainly, there&rsquo;s one theme I haven&rsquo;t touched on.</p>

<p>That is the theme of motivation.</p>

<p>Previously I stated that adulthood doesn&rsquo;t entail a dramatic shift in attitude towards life.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p>Adulthood does entail a dramatic shift in attitude, except most people never experience it.</p>

<p>For me, my shift in attitude occurred once I&rsquo;d moved out of home and got serious with my girlfriend.</p>

<p>I believe time pressure has something to do with it.</p>

<p>However ultimately, I know it&rsquo;s because of my future children.</p>

<p>The reason that keeps me going is knowing that my future children will have an amazing future, because of all the hard work I&rsquo;ve put in now.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what keeps me going and will continue to motivate me, for as long as I live.</p>

<p>I just didn&rsquo;t quite realise it until later in life.</p>

Currently as we speak, I have a left dagger in my eye and while the pain is excruciating, makes for a wonderful facebook post as I attempt to concoct the perfect selfie.  

I digress.


However there's also a subtle beauty to being an adult, which I think needs to be cherished and embraced. 

Today I want to talk about what it means to be an adult, because I think it's something ill-defined.

Not only in this quest to become a better adult, but also to allow you to live more effectively as a human being as well. 

Because guess what? 



The problem is that a lot of us grew up with shitty adult figures who didn't embrace the power of adulthood. 

Who quite frankly, were shit adults. 

Who were lazy, had no aspirations, and who suffered and who normalised this suffering as a basic fact of life. 



Being able to construct a building is a skill, being exceedingly attractive is a skill, having wit or wealth is a skill, including the one thing that transcends these all:

Your attitude towards life. 

These are top


In most cases attitude is usually the limiting factor.

Quite simply because, we have zero expectations of what it means to be an adult and so we don't convey ourselves effectively. 


Now while these are the things that make us adult, in practice it's not as easy as simply undesrtanding what needs to be done.

So here's some insight into what personally helps me be myself:


I mean, god knows how much time I spend writing these articles


The problem of course, is that it's something most of us are unprepared for. 

...which leads to acting like a complete spastic into your early 20s. 

Certainly, I have been culprit to this behaviour. 





Because at the end of the day, all effective adults have one thing in common: 

Everything they do prepares them for the future. 

Whether you want to raise three children or invent something spectactular (or perhaps both), you need to have the skills and attitude to do it. 

In fact, it will allow you to prepare for anything in life. 

Now this is where it gets tricky for us millenials, who are apparently retarded and hash-tag a little too much. 




Believe it or not, attitude is a skill. 

I like to think of it as an overarching skill that helps calibrate everything else in place. 

The great thing about developing skills is that it doesn't need to be so lenient as your attitude. 

You can develop whatever skills you please.

Ultimately passion sells itself and if you're really good at what you can do, you can get away with anything. 






So for example, you can be amazing at building things, yet not have the self-confidence or charisma to sell your creations.

In the game of 'the adult' this is a failure of attitude.

Which is totally fine, if that's your intention. 

You may not want to sell your creations, nor do you really care about creating things which are necessarily marketable. 

Self-expression and self-discovery are important, however remember that so is your adulthood. 

Balance. That's what we're going to talk about.
