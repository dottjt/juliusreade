      <description>Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re a struggle sport.
An undefined blob of human misery, awaiting death in a slurry of shame and complete unanticipation.
Maybe you feel unable to help yourself become successful, either due to lack of knowledge or ability to strive.
That&amp;rsquo;s right.
Welcome to the human experience.
With your host, the shitty human experience co-ordinator.
Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because you feel fearful or possibly shameful of the potential outcome, producing anxiety via your own self-perception.</description>
