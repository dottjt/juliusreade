      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re not stupid.
Gullible, probably. Delusional? Well, obviously.
I mean you&amp;rsquo;re on this website designed for misfit derelicts, which clearly indicates that there&amp;rsquo;s something very wrong with you.
Yet I don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re stupid.
Because as long as you have the ability to learn, you cannot possibly be stupid.
Your ability to learn is what makes you more powerful (and in a lot of cases, more irrational) than any other animal on this planet.</description>
