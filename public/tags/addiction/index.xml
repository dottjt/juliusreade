      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a pornography addict and quite frankly, it sucks.
I decided to write this article in order to provide some closure into what happens in my mind when I go full addict.
Because even though it&amp;rsquo;s an issue most men face and widely accept, I personally believe it&amp;rsquo;s not okay.
So rather than brush it over, I&amp;rsquo;m choosing to address it for the betterment of myself and society.
As always, addiction is an incredibly intimate and personal experience that touches us all in different ways.</description>
