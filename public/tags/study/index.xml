Intuitive Explanations Make You Mickey Mouse smart


--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re not stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gullible, probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delusional? Well, aren&amp;rsquo;t we all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, the fact that you&amp;rsquo;re on this website indicates that there&amp;rsquo;s something very wrong with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet inspite of your flaws, I don&amp;rsquo;t quite think you&amp;rsquo;re stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because as long as you have the ability to learn, you cannot possibly be stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your ability to learn is what makes you more powerful (and in a lot of cases, more irrational) than any other animal on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means you can achieve anything you want, assuming you play the game right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stupid on the other hand has no potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has no ability, because it is not self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we both know you&amp;rsquo;re keenly aware of your limitations, which is why you&amp;rsquo;re seeking answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want potential and you&amp;rsquo;ve come to ther right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website covers a number of techniques to help you learn a tremendous amount of information in a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And an integral part of this strategy is to understand concepts from an intuitive and engaging perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if you can&amp;rsquo;t understand everything with ease, you&amp;rsquo;ve already lost the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m not even joking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let it be known, intuitive explanations only play a small part in the overall learning strategy we will be developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it is an excellent starting point for those of us new to the whole &amp;ldquo;Julius Reade lifestyle&amp;rdquo; thing I&amp;rsquo;m clearly trying to sell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, allow me to explain the value of intuitive explanations and why you should buy them by the bucket-load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-effective-explanations&#34;&gt;What Are Effective Explanations?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/01-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;What Are Effective Explanations? &#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective explanations are comparable to compelling narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are exciting, logical stories which provide us with obvious hints and cues to help us understand any situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite frankly most explanations are awful, which in large part is intentional by design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the intricacies and politics of why, however the point is that effective communication is a skill that needs to be embraced and cherished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And creating a compelling narrative is arguably the most effective way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a helper, compelling narratives can be thought of as a timeline of getting from &amp;ldquo;I have literally no idea WHERE I am!&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;ah-ha!&amp;rdquo; moment of intuitive and comfortable understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, explanations are those vital tools which help us get to our &amp;ldquo;ah-ha!&amp;rdquo; moment of self-realisation, as we now become keenly aware that we&amp;rsquo;re actually trapped in a dungeon in a very SAW-like situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all explanations are made equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;terrible-explanations-01&#34;&gt;Terrible Explanations - 01&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/01-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Terrible Explanations&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrible explanations, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re aware, get us absolutely nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like an awful film tied together on a shoe-string budget, the plot makes no sense, you&amp;rsquo;re about ready to fall asleep and you still have no idea why the entire cast has been replaced by a series of talking traffic cones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, terrible explanations can even assist us to misunderstand our situation, bringing on a whole new world of pain to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet what makes terrible explanations so insidious is that they can seem completely rational, while actually being completely wrong and contrary to the actual situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterall, while humans would like to consider themselve rational creatures,  our collective actions obviously speak in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciphering between good and bad explanations is a seperate skill you will learn to decipher at another time, which becomes crucially important when selecting study material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the time being, it can help to keep your mind open and not become too invested in one set beliefs or ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, as we&amp;rsquo;ll discover later, so-called &amp;ldquo;incorrect&amp;rdquo; perspectives are not necessarily bad. They can often point out and help us understand more &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; perspectives a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, terrible explanations take us from &amp;ldquo;I have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m doing&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Why am I covered in blood?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;average-explanations-02&#34;&gt;Average Explanations - 02&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/01-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Average Explanations&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average explanations are really no better than terrible explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like average films, they’re entirely dull and forgettable. They take us 50% of the way there, if we&amp;rsquo;re lucky, assuming we haven&amp;rsquo;t already forgotten what we&amp;rsquo;ve watched by the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, and this is a key point on why intuitive explanations are so important, this also leaves us with the other 50% of the situation to  figure out for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which if you have depression, existing learning difficulties and emotional issues, is a gargantual task for even those well-attuned to the realities of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because let’s face it: When you’re depressed and are barely functioning, to expect someone to spend even 10% of their effort to try and help themselves is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, why spend more than 10% of the effort to learn something anyway? Energy is a limited and vital learning resource, so the less energy we can spend - the more bang we can get for our buck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is critical if we are to take advantage of those moments where we&amp;rsquo;re too tired to do anything rigorous, but still have the energy to absorb information or complete menial tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--

The importance of maintaining energy. 

--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an explanation to be effective, we need to be taken 90% to 95% of the way there, or as close as possible to full understanding as can be achieved, with as many possible cues and hints as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more the better. One key learning strategy we will discover is to present the same information in a number of different ways, so that we can have a more holisitic, and therefore more in-depth understanding of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;intuitive-explanations-03&#34;&gt;Intuitive Explanations - 03&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/01-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Intuitive Explanations&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where intuitive explanations fit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intuitive explanations are like timeless movies. They are beautiful and provide us with convincing narratives to help us better understand who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intuitive explanations are designed to take us 90% of the way there and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are designed to be so simple and obvious, that absolutely anyone can internalise them and come to a level of functional understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not getting it, then I promise it&amp;rsquo;s not your fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means either you need to use a different explanation or you need to break the explanation down into smaller, more logical steps for your mind to consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smaller and more logical you can make the steps, the more obvious and intuitive you can allow the explanation to become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, in the overall scheme of things, there are also other factors to consider - in particular the expectations we set for ourselves when learning  new subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;help-you&#34;&gt;Help You&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/01-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Helping Yourself&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though intuitive explanations can take you 90%, perhaps even 99% of the way there, you still need to find the effort to do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is often easier said than done and like anything in life, there are no guarantees, only statistical probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never-the-less, by following a proven process we can dramatically minimise these statistical probabilities so that we are in-control of our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like the process the army uses to train recruits. It largely works, because it&amp;rsquo;s a tested process that produces consistent results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only with intuition can we easily grasp the things which at first seem impossible: Like our depression, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the insurmountable takeaway from all this is that if you’re struggling with trying to understand anything in life, question the line or reasoning (the explanation) you&amp;rsquo;re relying on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When does the explanation stop making sense? Is it because I lack domain knowledge? Is it because it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;m learning this particular concept and I&amp;rsquo;m naturally uninformed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this kind of thinking can help us better understand the learning process, and help us become more efficient with our learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intuitive explanations are mostly important when starting out with difficult and dense concepts, such as undergraduate mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s all folks. Please let me know what you think in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be that guy. Go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 

However 

There are a lot of other things that we must conquer in order to become highly effective study robots (you will learn to become a highly-efficient Japanese sex bot at a later, more advanced stage).
