      <title>My Last Post, Hopefully</title>
      <link>https://juliusreade.com/2018/01/17/my-last-post-hopefully/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to take a break from writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I have a huge problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have issue communicating my thoughts honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a writer who&amp;rsquo;s obsessed with conveying the feigned realisation of both emotion and story, I could care less about the rigidness of interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is really great for you, the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And certainly, is what gives these words meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s a problem in the sense that it often lends towards the creation of these awful, twisted characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which inenvitably become me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is not fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And certainly, is not something anyone should ever aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I supposed it&amp;rsquo;s a double-edged sword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take these words personally which allows me to get close to them, and really understand them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s detrimental in that in ends up destroying me as I weep at the carnage of illogical consistency and jagged surrealness that tends to arise from my writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, part of the appeal of &amp;lsquo;words&amp;rsquo; is that you can treat them however you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you throw them around like dirt, it really shows in your writing and you become this nasty little creature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deranged, almost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However when you glorify them and give them literate titles, you can transform yourself into a modern aristocrat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(have I died and gone insane?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet dear reader, there&amp;rsquo;s quite a large gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which my mind feels obligated to fill and render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And distort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And surpise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And&amp;hellip; oh look, there&amp;rsquo;s a rabbit currently peering from out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(as you can tell, imagining things is a lot of fun)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet when you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At best these words are nothing more than commonly recognisable shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screaming for your love and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And listen, when you&amp;rsquo;ve taken as many drugs as I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely everything becomes abstract to the point of colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s why I love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they allow me to construct my own reality. My own battered sense of self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I pretend is just an entertaining story that I tell myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When really, is more like some kind of arcane force which consumes and controls me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m discovering however, at least as I become older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that I&amp;rsquo;m desiring to reconnect with reality, rather than disconnect from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why I must stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEGIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I have a lot to look forward to in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have my career which I love, as well as my incredible partner who cooks the most amazing meals, and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;END.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, this is the crucial moment in which I create the character, become manic and then splatter into a thousand different pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All equally as intangible as the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why it is in my best interest to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stop creating these characters, and to simply co-exist with the knowledge and understanding that everything is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That life dosn&amp;rsquo;t have to be some kind of outstanding narrative, fit with the insanity that coerces it&amp;rsquo;s way into my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mental health is simply too precious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must remove all distractions from my life, and make it as simple as possible to simply remain aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can be within walking distance of my mind, and not get caught up in the mental traps I tend to set for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seclusion, with a hint of lime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You dirty man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 


I suppose there are a lot of posts you will never have the opportunity to read. 

For example, the post about what it was like to grow up with two fathers, or the eight billion self-help guides I&#39;ve managed to write over the past year. 

...as they enter the digital graveyard of my harddrive, never to be seen again. 


A reality far away from the fantasy worlds of suffering and grandeur that I&#39;ve created. 

Based on the women from my past, the events of my trauma, and the awfulness of my childhood. 

It is ugly. 

It is benign.

It is pointless. 

And while part of me knew this all along, I was also scared and afraid. 

Scared and afraid to let go.

And so I held onto my shadow under the thin guise of hope, that maybe these memories could provide me with some sense of wellbeing. 

I was wrong. 

(although, I can write really well now, so not all was lost!)

On the other hand, there was another contributing factor to my demise. 


And the sheer arrogance to believe that I was immune from these words. 

That story could exist without a narrator, hastily chewing through the pages of his own filth.

      <title>Daddy Reade&#39;s Delicious Comeback</title>
      <link>https://juliusreade.com/2017/12/03/daddy-reades-delicious-comeback/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 16:23:26 +1300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://juliusreade.com/2017/12/03/daddy-reades-delicious-comeback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Please allow me to elaborate on what&amp;rsquo;s taken place over these past few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a break from writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, to let go of the fear and obligation I feel for having to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I think I&amp;rsquo;ve happily achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I no longer stress about having to write these posts, nor maintain this illusion that I&amp;rsquo;m slicker than crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because let&amp;rsquo;s be quite honest, my dear and lovely reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re nothing more than sociopathic ego-wank and as good as it feels to glorify myself in same way that Lil Wayne thinks he&amp;rsquo;s cooler than a carton of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s secondary to actually buying a set of grills and shouting the n-word like an autistic child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my second point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing because I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy building my media empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a sick dog regurgitating on it&amp;rsquo;s own vomit, people will happily pay to witness the self-deprivation in full view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And oh boy, how I will make these people pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this incredible startup idea that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hastily piecing together over these past months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve put my heart and soul into this project, and it&amp;rsquo;s been absolutely delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mouth-wateringly fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, what I&amp;rsquo;ve gone and done is built my own automated, affiliate marketing CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;lsquo;automated&amp;rsquo; here is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can achieve in 2 minutes what would ordinarily take &amp;lsquo;the average marketer&amp;rsquo; 30 minutes to do manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I&amp;rsquo;m going to kill and leave the competition out for dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more shitty Wordpress templates with outdated Bootstrap frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more grown adults pretending that SEO is an acroynym for Indian spyware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is business, baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am literally going to chew through the internet like a madman with a semi-automatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I&amp;rsquo;m going to sacrifice their mothers to the gods of online shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good UX and design? Check. Incredible brand awareness? Check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the best thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My baby is fully scalable so I can create as many websites as I want, at minimal cost and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the technical skill, most of these marketers are paying $12 for hosting per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per website - on some awful shared-hosting plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myself on the other hand, am paying a flat $5 fee per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an incredibly fast dedicated server - and each website I add on top of that is completely free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, unlike the derelict one-toothed whore that is Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My CMS is blazingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so fast it&amp;rsquo;s built on fuckin&amp;rsquo; Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which also keeps server costs down, because it uses dramatically less resources than a Wordpress website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let alone a bloated Wordpress website with 50,000 plugins and an incompetent admin who&amp;rsquo;s spewing his guts over the husk remains of his shit-bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say in life you need two prominent skills to be successful, and in my case it&amp;rsquo;s marketing and web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m excited because it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve pursued something with an effective and proven buisness model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, it&amp;rsquo;s as if I&amp;rsquo;ve been unconsciously preparing for this moment my entire life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those websites and brands I&amp;rsquo;ve created over the years, not to mention all that time wasted in Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing unsolicited poetry in hope that girls would notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culminating into the precipice of this very wonderful venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I believe will make me very, very rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about every other venture I&amp;rsquo;ve rushed into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I could be entirely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These online brands are 100% me, and that&amp;rsquo;s all I really have in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, you never really sell products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sell personality and that&amp;rsquo;s why I think it&amp;rsquo;s going to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I like who I am, and I think a lot of other people will to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building monetary funnels upon the shoulders of giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I could go on about how I severely pulled my back during a recent deadlift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which put me out of action for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(resulting in learning of fine art)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or how I&amp;rsquo;m currently suffering from the most debilitating fever I&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(it&amp;rsquo;s been nearly two weeks and I&amp;rsquo;m still sick)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m on course to do something amazing, and so that&amp;rsquo;s what I want you to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your participation is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awful Christmas is the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://awfulchristmas.com/&#34;&gt;https://awfulchristmas.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dun forget it.&lt;/p&gt;

Allow Me To Describe Why I&#39;m No Longer Mentally Ill


I think I may have discovered how to be happy

It&#39;s taken me four years to address my mental health. 

I think I discovered how to be happy. 

Allow me to describe why I&#39;m no longer mentally ill
Allow me to describe why I&#39;m no longer mentally ill
Allow me to explain why I&#39;m no longer mentally ill

Allow Me To Explain Why I&#39;m No Longer Mentally Ill
How I Dissolved A Lifetime Of Mental Illness
How To Dissolve A Lifetime Of Mental Illness
Why I&#39;m No Longer Mentally Ill

Holy Shit. I&#39;m No Longer Mentally Ill. 


I just discovered what mental illness is. 
This is your mind on mental illness. 
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go as far as to say that I&amp;rsquo;m no longer mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it assumes a kind of permanence I cannot prove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what I would like to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that I&amp;rsquo;ve made some very dramatic changes over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that as a result of those changes, I feel as if I&amp;rsquo;m a completely different person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m smiling a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t seem like a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m literally smiling all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m smiling right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I highly recommend you give it a try too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What essentially happened is that I took this mental health course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(as part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://wwww.pathwaytohappiness.com&#34;&gt;https://wwww.pathwaytohappiness.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it literally broke me in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m self-aware with all my beliefs, thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel as if I&amp;rsquo;m in control of every single aspect of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I feel genuinely happy and full of life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been nothing short of life changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the problem, I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least from your point of view, my dear reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it appears that I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from one extreme to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if I&amp;rsquo;ve joined some kind of ideological cult, where the idea of severe punishment entails whipping myself with a cast iron chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is a fair assessment, and perfectly understanable provided my bipolar tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, please allow me to try and explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I haven&amp;rsquo;t died and gone insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the truth is, this has been a four-year long journey for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s been only until recent that it&amp;rsquo;s all begun to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;virtual-reality&#34;&gt;Virtual Reality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/23-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Virtual Reality&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to know exactly where to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And certainly, I think this article can only serve as a basic overview of the concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve adopted over the past month or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I think it might help if I provide you with an understanding of how we develop mental illness in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(at least as far as I&amp;rsquo;m aware)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it will ease you into understanding the process with which to dismantle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to imagine this idea of the virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This place where nothing is real, and yet appears to feel real in every sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This place we create and fabricate out of our own imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like a dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, sure. We may draw inspiration from the real world within this virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However that isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that this virtual reality is the original source of our consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A concept which I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain throughout this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is this virtual reality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it can take many different forms, some easier to understand than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of simplicity, let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the virtual reality most of us are familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtual reality of the digital, online world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a flat 2D surface we can literally experience the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can view images which depict scenes and places well beyond our physical location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play around with simulations which take us through the intricate details of human anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch videos based on outlandish, fantasy worlds - with creatures that do not exist in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play video games that allow us to control characters to achieve the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even witness accounts that took places hundreds of years ago within public archives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online world allows you to do almost anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a result of these wonderful attributes, many of us have already become quite efficient at embracing this idea of the virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much so, that many of us have now become dependent on the internet for a large majority of the information we consume and experience on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this online virtual experience goes far deeper than we think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when we read something compelling online we don&amp;rsquo;t just take it at face value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We construct this conceptual imagination in our minds to connect with the information we are taking in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An imagination which produces thoughts and emotions, which help develops our understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily because of the contents we&amp;rsquo;re consuming (because almost everything online is subjective), but because of our perception of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our perception and belief of what is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, we produce a certain thought or emotional reaction because of our beliefs, even though what we are comprehending is inherently virtual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be fake news or it could be something that&amp;rsquo;s happened thousands of kilometres away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we percieve the content to be compelling, due to what we believe, we treat and hold sacred the text we read on our computer screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No different to the emotional reaction we recieve when we play a video game or watch a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, slaying a virtual dragon wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we would just sit there dumbfounded, realising that we&amp;rsquo;re doing nothing more than mashing a bunch of plastic buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of a flat panel screen made of metal and plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(which is actually what tends to happen over time, as I&amp;rsquo;ll soon explain)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, our imagination is what bridges this abstraction from our mechanical actions, to our virtual understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing particularly wrong with having these feelings or reactions towards the virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what tends to happen over time, is that our sense of reality can become distorted or exaggerated by this virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either we can become desensitised to our virtual experiences, or we can find them overly disturbing and real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, we end up failing to distinguish between our real and imagined reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either rejecting the medium, or embracing it further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would say it&amp;rsquo;s a conflict most of us struggle with to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider something like Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This completely virtual representation of our social lives that feels as if we&amp;rsquo;re truly interacting with our friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can produce the same social anxiety and feeling of rejection inherent within our physical friendships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we&amp;rsquo;re literally doing nothing more than hitting a couple of button on our phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In completely separate locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this has all been one elaborate introduction to segue into what I actually want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the online world is merely one example of a virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other and perhaps most important example of a virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which many of us do not consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the virtual reality of our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;understanding-thoughts-and-emotions&#34;&gt;Understanding Thoughts And Emotions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/23-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Understanding Thoughts And Emotions&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news, and perhaps why we&amp;rsquo;re lucky to be trying to understand mental illness in today&amp;rsquo;s day and age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that most of us are already quite familiar with how virtual realities work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether we&amp;rsquo;re engaging in a fantasy novel, watching a movie or reading an article online - we&amp;rsquo;ve become quite adept at embracing these virtual worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which really, is bloody fantastic because it means we&amp;rsquo;re already halfway to understanding how mental illness functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we have to do now is become aware of how we interact with hem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what exactly is this virtual reality of the mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In broader terms, it consists of the imagined (or percieved) experiences we have of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More simply it consists of the thoughts and emotions we experience on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I want us to focus on our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most of us tend to better understand our thoughts, than compared to our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(at least so we think)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there are two very interesting things to note about how most of us tend to percieve our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there is this general idea that our thoughts are created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That we have this ability to consciously think a &amp;lsquo;thought&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which in other words, means that we can control what we think and when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, and perhaps most interestingly, is this idea that our thoughts are virtual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which some of us may or may not agree with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I would say that there&amp;rsquo;s this general understanding in society that thoughts don&amp;rsquo;t exist in a physical sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that they merely serve as a virtual concept in our minds to be tinkered around with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the end goal of rationalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- For example, we can just as easily destroy a thought, as we can create one.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Often, without process.  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and this is where most people lose their shit)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That our emotions are no different to our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are both equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like a thought, emotions can also be created at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like a thought, they are both completely virtual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the two are completely interchangable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose what makes this information so striking, is that it tends to go against what most people commonly believe about their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, most people tend to view their emotions as being separate from their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Now, I&#39;m not expecting you to believe me.

At all.  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the usual reaction I get from most people is complete and utter rejection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply because they have a very different model of how their emotions work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, most people have this idea that their thoughts have some kind of control over their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sense that they need a reason or a belief in order to feel something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is understandable, given that I once used to think like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say in respect to this (at least for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that by learning and unlearning how the mind works, I can now direct my feelings and emotions without the need for logic or reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is to say that I can simply create happiness, by willfully &amp;hellip;creating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the reason why many of us tend to view this seperation between our thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is because it&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;ve learnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since birth we&amp;rsquo;ve taught ourselves this idea that our emotions cannot be willfully created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it becomes this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which through repeated experience, seeds itself into a belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s what becomes our reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tragic, sufferable reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now please allow me to explain why that reality is a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;understanding-beliefs&#34;&gt;Understanding Beliefs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/23-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Understanding Beliefs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provided my understanding of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as my understanding of how humans form beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(which admittedly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t go into much detail about, however will try to explain in this chapter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the aim of addressing mental illness is to develop the ability to control our virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hence, how we interpret reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing more. Nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does one do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, for starters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begs to note that you&amp;rsquo;re already in control of your virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understandably, you may not be aware of it, nor have the skills to enact on it with your current understanding of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that you don&amp;rsquo;t already have the facilities to control what you think, how you feel, as well as what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, rejection of this understanding forms merely one of the many self-limiting beliefs people have of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-limiting beliefs which result in a state of mental illness for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they&amp;rsquo;re too afraid to let go of their fear-based beliefs which trap them within their own mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the belief that they will always remain mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The belief that there is nothing they can do to change who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few reasons why you are in fact, solely responsible for your own thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to understand why, we need to take a closer look at our language, which is where a lot of our implicit beliefs hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, sometimes we can feel frustrated at the actions of another person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do the thing that frustrates us, which creates an emotional reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we say in response &amp;lsquo;that person really pisses me off&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our language, we attribute the way we feel to their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and is also part of the reason why we develop this idea that our emotions must be caused by a reason)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s just a lie we tell ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a lie because it completely neglects how we actually create emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, what&amp;rsquo;s actually happened is that their action activated one of our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which says that &amp;lsquo;I am going to feel pissed off when they do this thing&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost as we set ourselves up for failure through our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we get so caught up in the emotional reaction, that we don&amp;rsquo;t have the awareness to realise the witness the underlying belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the reason why mental illness is so predictable. It&amp;rsquo;s merely a pattern we repeat due to what we believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understandably it&amp;rsquo;s all very subtle, but that&amp;rsquo;s what happens in our brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s the sole reason why you&amp;rsquo;re responsible for your own thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the actions of the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, you and your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this arguably is the hardest thing for people suffering from mental illness to undesrtand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That they are responsible for their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that others aren&amp;rsquo;t responsible for activating them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why many of us continue to suffer in denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this idea that we have control over ourselves, perhaps because it&amp;rsquo;s too much for us to bare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, humans are rational creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a side-effect of this, we don&amp;rsquo;t actually care what reason we come across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just want a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be a reason with a fundamental flaw. It could be complete gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our brain doesn&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just wants to feel as if it&amp;rsquo;s in control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desperation at it&amp;rsquo;s purist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;self-awareness&#34;&gt;Self-Awareness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/23-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Self-Awareness&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the way we use our language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways we abdicate our power away through our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely, because that&amp;rsquo;s what beliefs do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They take our limited willpower and they invest it in an interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, by limiting our beliefs and the influence they have over ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greater power we can have over the decisions we make, as well as our own interpretation of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which really is to say that our beliefs are merely lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These personal interpretations that we commit to ourselves, often based in faulty rationalisation, and that merely narrow our point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, beliefs are just another construct of virtual reality, no different to our thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constructs which can be created and destroyed within an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, does this mean that they&amp;rsquo;re not useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with this understanding we can have greater control over what we believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely, by letting go of our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And simply being present with ourselves, as an alternative to holding on to these prefabricated interpretations of what reality is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the approach most people take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, most people will recognise a problem, and try and create these kinds of &amp;lsquo;counter-beliefs&amp;rsquo; to reassure themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when someone feels as if they&amp;rsquo;re unworthy or not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;ll try to perk themselves up by telling themselves that they&amp;rsquo;re amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only to end up feeling worse about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why is because they&amp;rsquo;re still fighting with their underlying beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which positive reinforcement does nothing to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A losing battle which merely results in further guilt and shame, making them feel worse about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they battle this self-image which tells them otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the foundation of one lie, they try to treat it with another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pointless act at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/23-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Conclusion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going on in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely, not very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m slowly hunting and dissolving the beliefs in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m refraining from giving away my willpower to personal interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I find quite beneficial, provided my lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than worrying or doubting myself, I find myself spending more time doing the things I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m feeling positive about my life, and my attitude towards life has changed significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refrain from judging others (well, at least when I&amp;rsquo;m self-aware of it), and I keep my mind from wandering off into those narratives of guilt and anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely helped me avoid a lot of unnecessary emotional reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve become more forgiving of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I no longer have a breakdown when I think of my ex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(which is a huge thing for me)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even no longer get triggered by sexual images, because I no longer hold onto that personal interpretation in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find myself becoming much more accepting and tolerant of situations which I feel like are out of my control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though of course, there are still a few things that freak me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as a few self-limiting beliefs I haven&amp;rsquo;t quite been able to approach, such as the topic of my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the way I see it is that if I do a little bit each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I&amp;rsquo;ll gradually see improvements overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that each second spent being happy is going to have a net-positive effect to my wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As through small agreements we create large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the message I want to get across is that mental illness can be conquered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that change is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if that means spending an entire lifetime in hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Regardless.

The two are distinguishable entities.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Much like how we are able to distinguish between our dreams and our physical reality, if not through label.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- And one way you can do that is by understanding that virtual reality is like a kind of dream world, whereas actually reality is more like a conscious world.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Now you may claim that this statement may be a, because something like fake news isn&#39;t inherently real.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Now, the reason why we know internally that we may or may not be actually killing a dragon.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- It&#39;s easy to understand that while a lot of these things feel real to us, because they&#39;ve become so engrained within our culture. 

That isn&#39;t to say that these things are actually real. 

Now, this isn&#39;t to say that there are some aspects of the virtual reality that we don&#39;t find weird. 

Like when people get married to inanimate objects or think they&#39;re actually a fox, rather than a human. 

However, so was online dating at one point - yet now it&#39;s considered normal.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- And becoming involved within cultivating them within our culture. 

For example, Star Wars is a virtual reality I&#39;m sure most of us are familiar with in some way. 

Which most of us have embraced to some degree.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Now of course, once we become effcient at thinking. 

Usually through repitition. 

We can automate this process, so that we can think subconsciously.

Simply because it can make our daily lives easier.

And hell, it becomes one less thought to worry about. 
 --&gt;

&lt;!-- I mean, sure. 

We can describe our thoughts with words and derive meaning from them.

However that isn&#39;t to say that they don&#39;t only exist as part of our perception of reality.

This virtual reality of our mind. --&gt;

&lt;!-- (although for a lot of people, it may not be a skill that they have) --&gt;

&lt;!-- Even though both can be created and destroyed at will.   --&gt;

&lt;!-- Much like our thoughts, our emotions can be destroyed and created at will. --&gt;

&lt;!-- And yet we treat them both as seperate entities.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Now, just because I&#39;m telling you that they&#39;re the same, doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m expected you to necessarily believe it. 

And certainly, the aim of this article is to explain why this is the case. 

Certainly, the reaction of most people is to reject, because it goes against their own belief of how the mind works.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Let&#39;s talk about beliefs. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Because they&#39;re the real culprit here.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- It also means that you have the power to believe and to percieve reality.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- It&#39;s that we can control our virtual reality - specifically our thoughts and emotions.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- The only thing that&#39;s missing is the understanding and skill to pull it off. 

I suppose I compare it to weightlifting. 

Initially, you can&#39;t lift much. 

However through constant training, you slowly develop the muscle to  --&gt;

&lt;!-- After all, it&#39;s not like I can actually push a button in your brain.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- The reason why it may seem like you&#39;re not in control of your thoughts and emotions is due to the beliefs you hold. --&gt;

&lt;!-- The hidden secret pulling your strings. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Reality exists without our beliefs.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- They are lies because we use them to try and convey a sense of reality, when really they are just concrete interpretations of it  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Of course, the problem is that most people don&#39;t realise this.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- So when they recognise that they have these fear based beliefs or beliefs which produce emotional reaction.

And what do they do?  --&gt;

&lt;!-- 

For example, someone may not like their body image.

So what do they do?

They subject themselves with images of these body types in order to try and create a positive image. 


And what happens? 

Nothing.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Life no longer feels like this unbearable rollercoaster, with it&#39;s incessant ups and downs.

I feel genuinely happy and full of life. 

Which has made everything so much easier.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- 

In particular, the opportunity  --&gt;

&lt;!-- The main attraction of &#39;virtual reality&#39; is that it allows us to experience things which we cannot in the real world.

However, I would argue that almost everyone in today&#39;s day and age feels conflicted in this regard.

Such as slaying a dragon in your favourite video game.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- And for some people. 

In fact, most people - as we&#39;ll come to discover.

We&#39;re struggling to distinguish between our real and imagined reality. 

And I mean that quite seriously. 

Now, this statement may seem outlandish, or perhaps only applicable to a select few. 

Which again, may seem outlandish and inapplicable to most people. 


However, I would argue that almost everyone in today&#39;s day and age feels conflicted in this regard.

Perhaps without truly realising it.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- 
However let&#39;s take a closer look at how we integrate this idea of the virtual reality into our lives.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Which when we start considering things like virtual relationships, or spend our lives within simulated worlds.  --&gt;

&lt;!--





I feel happy.

Where to begin. 

Lately I&#39;ve been feeling incredibly positive about my life. 

I no longer feel straddled in the self-limiting fears and beliefs which held me down. 

Of course, I&#39;m not perfect. 

There are still things I&#39;m afraid of, like spiders - for example. 

However things from my past which used to traumatise me and trigger me.

No longer have that effect on me. 

Again, I&#39;m not perfect and I haven&#39;t reclaimed absolutely every single event  in my life. 

However I&#39;m there enough that I feel incontrol, and it&#39;s something I work towards and grow each day. 




Unlike physical reality, virtual reality isn&#39;t something that&#39;s forced upon you.

(at least for a large majority of people with mental illness, unlike something like schizophrenia)

Virtual reality is something you create in your mind. 

Many people reject this idea that we have control over our emotinos 



 to view our emotions as being an integral part of our physical reality. 

We view our emotions as something sacred, something tangible, a source of truth. 

They do not understand that their emotions are not a reflection of physical reality. 

And this is the reason why things like mental illness exists.

So what exactly are the consequences of confusing our virtual reality with our physical reality? 




I&#39;ll let you figure that one out on your own.

So.

I had one of those moments.

I&#39;m not exactly sure when it happened, but I think it had a lot to do with my last post.

My last post was quite personal and traumatic for me. 

I personally noticed that I was quite drawn into the story as I writing it. 

As I relived events in mind that happened many years ago.

Events that I continue to relive on a constant basis. 

And as I was writing, something sparked in my mind like a wildfire. 

This notion of empowerment which fundamentally shattered my perception of reality.

I decided at that moment that I was going to focus on my mental health.

Just as I did this same time four years ago. 

To deal with the exact same issues which having been plaguing me since then. 

And my gosh, 




Before I continue it may help to think of these ideas as mere abstractions. 

For example, a thought or an emotion can be viewed as an abstraction. 

They don&#39;t exist as a concrete entity. 

Rather, we give them meaning through description aka words. 

It helps in that it  --&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger warning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s the point, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It completely destroys me to write this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I still have issues dealing with my first relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose &amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that continues to linger as an unresolved aspect of my personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I hope to adddress today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since writing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken some very strong steps towards addressing my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while it&amp;rsquo;s been excruciatingly difficult at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;rsquo;m heading in the right direction - and fuck it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel happy. Genuinely happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s something I want to write about in my next post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about these things no longer makes me feel sad nor cause an emotional reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this article was essentially written two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we resume sad, somewhat confused Julius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important for me to write this, because I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s the last frontier in my quest for mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That one issue I still haven&amp;rsquo;t quite been able to crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that continues to affect me on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post will be to describe my first relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with all the issues that continue to tantilise me on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely, because I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a lot worse lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I used to be able to go months at a time without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However now I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that this is no longer the case, and I know it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve been neglecting my mental health recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything will be fine&amp;hellip; until it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;ll all come flooding back to me like a bad dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;rsquo;m just sick and tired of falling through this predictable cycle, again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be so much better than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence why I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a whole range of emotions that I attach to this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predominantly, guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel as if I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for all the awful things in her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which then transpires into shame, along with other useless, negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel shame because I cannot accept her for who she is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I know that I could only accept her as a partner, which makes me feel small and unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it completely neglects all the wonderful aspects of her personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely however, I feel trampled in guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I hope to discuss in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-premise&#34;&gt;The premise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/22-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;The premise&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you should probably try to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a long distance relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met online and it was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d actually come to genuinely like a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps ever, in my entire life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I was a complete cynic when it came to women and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only because of the constant fighting I&amp;rsquo;d experienced between my mother and her relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However also because of mother herself - the worst example of a woman, ever produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utter garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think part of what made it feel so special was the fact that it happened so organically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organic to the point that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even realise we were in a relationship until a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that we were talking every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I thought she was the best thing since sliced bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was intelligent. Gorgeously attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we would chat everyday over Skype into the late hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was love fantasy central.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ummmm, where did it go all so wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brace yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, we both had very severe mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Very Severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had an eating disorder, amongst a range of other issues that I would only find out until later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myself on the other hand&amp;hellip; I was self-destructive, completely delusional and severely attached in the worst possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardly a sustainable combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find striking is that I remember the exact point at which it all broke down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember it so vividly, because it was the moment that sweet girl I adored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permanently broke down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the moment that she disappeared forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember she was crying in a complete fit of hysteria, trying to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of her &amp;lsquo;friends&amp;rsquo; had claimed to have killed himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it turns out that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t true and that he was only &amp;lsquo;joking&amp;rsquo; - which only made it worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God knows why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet from that moment onwards, it was as if she transformed into something unrecognisable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or rather, it was as if she resumed the narrative of darkness that craddled her on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She became a pit of suicidal remonition and depression, to the point of inertia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember she would just sit there and cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And tell me how she wanted to kill herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, it was an aspect of her personality she was trying to hide from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hide from herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Well, okay.

That&#39;s not a fair assessment because I don&#39;t know depression is actually who we are on the inside.

But rather, it was the archtype she was most willing to believe in her mind.  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And part of me&amp;hellip; couldn&amp;rsquo;t accept that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, she was the love of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in my place of heightened euphoria, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand to see her like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in attempting to to do the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And risk destroying absolutely everything we had in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to help her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-delusion&#34;&gt;The Delusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/22-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Delusion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the problem with a word like &amp;lsquo;help&amp;rsquo; is that it&amp;rsquo;s completely subjective in ways that hurt the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially within the context of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues were numerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) I had literally zero experience with women AND relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) I could barely change myself, and so the idea of changing someone else was absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) She lived in an entirely different country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) She wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready, nor willing to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e) Most importantly, a person&amp;rsquo;s mental illness is completely out of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the list goes on forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, you&amp;rsquo;re completely fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do nothing, then they continue their self-destructive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how the fuck do you not take that personally, when someone is claiming to be on the verge of death?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet if you do something, you only serve to make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they end up hating you and perhaps, end up loathing themselves more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Well actually, there&#39;s a third option that I&#39;ve come to understand. 

Acceptance of the situation - which essentially means leaving the relationship. 

Of course, I was waaaayyy too naive and head-over-heels at the time to have considered it.  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that my attempts at helping her merely turned her off wanting to help herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, to compensate (at least within my own mind) I decided to become more attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that if I displayed more affection that maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll make her feel better about herself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, because it&amp;rsquo;ll make her feel loved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Just as I felt about her?   --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, it ended up having the exact opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, it made her feel even more exhausted than she already was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember she would always say that everything was utterly exhausting for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if everything in her life were a chore, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(obviously, I took that personally in the worst possible way)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between her eating disorder, irregular sleeping patterns and excessive self-judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to blame her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why I ended up blaming myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I&amp;rsquo;ve also come to understand that my affection served as a coping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t deal with the fact that my sweetheart had disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I ended up creating this fantasy image of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To repress who she really was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to continue that ditzy &amp;lsquo;love story&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;d created in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember I would just sit there and think about her in this sort of daze of euphoria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if she were this kind of goddess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in my affection, I would create these wild stories in my mind about how amazing she was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process, becoming this kind of emotional zombie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obsessed with something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t real, nor there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I created the impression in my mind that we would be together forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I suppose, helped deal with hearing that she was suicidal on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, she would comment on being triggered each time she&amp;rsquo;d walk past the train tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t deny that this must have been awful for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wish her well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However imagine me, this guy who&amp;rsquo;s never experienced love, nor ever been in a relationship in his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally discover the woman of his &amp;lsquo;dreams&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is now being told on a daily basis that the person they love most wants to kill themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unable to do anything because their girlfriend lives in a completely different country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let alone hold them or reassure them that everything will be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I feel guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I feel helpless at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- It was conflicting, because on the one hand I didn&#39;t want to lose her. 

On the other hand, I knew I would lose her if she remained suicidal.  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did what anyone would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put everything on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did everything in my power to try to help her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet in the end, the only way I could help her was by deluding myself into thinking that everything was okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-visit&#34;&gt;The visit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/22-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;The visit&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the breakdown, we decided to meet in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember anxiously counting down the days over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awaiting her arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the thing that excited me the most was that we were going to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d only had sex once in my life, and now I was going to have a whole weekend of sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, she came over for a total of three days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was the last I ever saw of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the night she arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pouring down rain, and I&amp;rsquo;d gone on my bike to see my friend in Box Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some 15 minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I remember checking the time, realising that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get home before her taxi arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I rode my bike as fast as I could and I remember speeding into my driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see her standing at my front door, speaking with my housemate who could barely speak English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She must have been terrified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly got her in and into my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I sat at my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was both terrified and completely out of breath from rushing home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completely clueless as to how I should approach her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So she kindly asked me to sit next to her on the bed, and we started to kiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it begs to note that our relationship was incredibly short-lived relatiosnhip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only lasted 2 - 3 months at most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think that&amp;rsquo;s part of what made it so difficult for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never truly felt like I got to know her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, when I come to think about it, there&amp;rsquo;s very little that I actually know about her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely because of this intense fantasy image I created of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because in reality, her depression formed a large part of her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which you realise, ends up being quite repetitive and plain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve tried reconnecting with her, pretending as if everything were still okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And everytime I&amp;rsquo;d ask her anything she&amp;rsquo;d provide me with the exact same answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like literally, that would be her answer to everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably because she was so exhausted all the time, and simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t comprehend anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, in my hyper &amp;lsquo;take-everything-personally&amp;rsquo; state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like, how do I even interpret this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is she lying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does she actually not know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is she even in any mental state to be asking these questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A futile quest in trying to understand something which will never reveal itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose one aspect that makes me feel sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this idea that it&amp;rsquo;s almost as if I never existed in her world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if she didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the energy to comprehend who I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s so much that goes unsaid within this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like when I blamed her for not being able to orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that she cheated on me with her ex, and even tried to become his fiancee weeks post-breakup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or like when I got my friend who was a psychology student to talk to her over Skype in order to help her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, talk about awkward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in attempting not to write a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-reveal&#34;&gt;The Reveal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/22-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Reveal&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I decided it was best to break up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could no longer deal with her depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, in my humpty-dumpty fantasy land I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually realise we were breaking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, I was under the impression that we were merely taking time apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we could regroup later, once we&amp;rsquo;d both sorted out our mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least that&amp;rsquo;s what I tried to communicated to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I was too naive to understand otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, she&amp;rsquo;d become so emotionally dead that I don&amp;rsquo;t even think she recognised that we were even in a relationship at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it was only once we broke up that she explained the rest of her story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(well actually, I remember being very passive-aggressive when she eventually gave in)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was raped as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was a dysfunctional alcoholic as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;d experienced all sorts of odd relationships with all sorts of different men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in my mind, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think - why didn&amp;rsquo;t you just tell me this stuff earlier?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Why? Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I think part of the reason was due to my naivety and lack of maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the delusion I&amp;rsquo;d fallen into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I think she&amp;rsquo;d recognised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was from this moment that I developed this intense insecurity within me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, fucking intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became highly insecure around this idea that she was hiding something from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it became this kind of wild obsession of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which would continue to linger for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time she&amp;rsquo;d kept something from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when we were together, she&amp;rsquo;d made a post on her blog about doing something for a &amp;lsquo;client&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I became intently curious, and so I asked her what she meant by that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately, she changed the wording on her post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if my girlfriend was a sex worker of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 
Which lead to this intense obsession which ravished me on the inside.

  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from that moment of discovering these things about her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would begin to obsess about her daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not in a pleasant way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I would just sit there in agitation, fighting my own imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get her out of my head, and the more I thought about her, the worse I became.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s just basic neurology and self-reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually my curiosity turned into this intense anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would rip me apart and ravish me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly couldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to make things worse, she told me I was the only person she could speak to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As everyone else had cut her out of their life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet because I was so heart-broken and irrational, I decided to shut her down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- And I became incredibly passive-aggressive in trying to deal with my emotions. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And cut her out of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt conflicted because I still loved her, yet I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite know who I loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it my image or her, or the actual person I was speaking to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt angered and torn, unable to deal with it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the first time in my life, I remember experiencing my first suicidal thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at work, unloading a pallet of goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ol&amp;rsquo; shelf-stacker I was)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I remember picking up a bottle of garden poison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thinking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It honestly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make a difference if I just swallowed the whole thing right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few moments later I had an intense emotional break down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I decided to go home early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/22-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Problem&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mental health problems are numerous, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve come to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I feel like they can be summarised down into two main points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I still view her as the perfect girl in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perfect person I will never talk to again, nor make acquaintance with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is jarring, because I know it&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than this elaborate image within my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps it might help to understand the narrative that takes place within my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She is the perfect girl.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, she would be perfect if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for her mental health issues.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And you Julius Reade, are the reason why she has those mental health issues.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because you failed to help her, and you made her life worse.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely, I feel guilt for leaving her, and not seeing her through with her mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(the glaring assumption I make in my mind, is that it&amp;rsquo;s even possible to see someone through with their mental health issues)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel guilt for all the ways in which I did try to help her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel gult for all the genuinely awful things I contributed towards the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel guilt for my incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel guilt for not being able to accept her for having mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s this part I feel the most guilt for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that just what happens when you become irrationally attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which then makes me feel guilty for even existing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my mind will endlessly loops through these points like a faulty circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paralyzing me entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the cure to all this madness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, dissolving this idea that she&amp;rsquo;s some kind of perfect god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is incredibly hard to do, given how attractive and intelligent she actually is in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;or at the very least, have portrayed her to be in this grand image I hold in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-acceptance is also a huge thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to accept the circumstances for what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to accept myself for who I am, and understand that I am not a reflection of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to accept that all these ideas I have merely exist within my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to accept the fact that I am not responsible for her mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as accept the fact that I have the power to change and become a better person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, I have my own issues to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the difficult thing about experiencing guilt is that you completely discount the responsibility other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely, that she is responsible for her mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that only she has business in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Which makes me feel uneasy because it&#39;s like, how am I suppose to know where that line exists?  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Are you never supposed to help anyone.  --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-positive&#34;&gt;The Positive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/22-06.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Positive&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s one thing I can&amp;rsquo;t deny, it&amp;rsquo;s that breaking up with her was important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was important because it signified the first time in my life that I&amp;rsquo;d decided to take my mental health seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite realise it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the fact that I even had the courage to call it off, I think, was a huge thing for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- And even though I end up doing a lot of stupid things. --&gt;

&lt;!-- I suppose I&#39;ve always considered myself a fighter. 

As a reflection of this idea that there&#39;s a very strong part of me that refuses to go full-retard.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- And I&#39;m glad that I&#39;ve been able to break out of my haze. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That moment of change was also quite violent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d had an incredibly &amp;lsquo;bad&amp;rsquo; trip on a particular recreational research chemical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(unintentionally, mind you - well, I guess it depends on how you view the self-destruction)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I literally went insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up breaking my arm by repeatedly punching in a solid glass door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nearly punched a woman in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole street was out to witness me scream in percieved agony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the rain poured and a pair of policemen pulled their guns on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was taken to hospital, where I abused staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(very long story, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about it some time)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully my mother was away overseas, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the point is, I was a complete wreck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following my release from hospital, I decided to buy as much junk food as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just the absolute worst processed shit you can think of, so I could binge my sorrows away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I remember buying this massive pack of Woolworths cheesy schnitzels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That just looked so damn good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I remember lying in bed, struggling to eat the fucking thing (my right arm was in a cast).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready to dry-wretch at how fucking god-awful these schnitzels were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it suddenly hit me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised that I no longer wanted to live my life like this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that I was going to take my mental health seriously for once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that point onwards, I felt willing to do absolutely everything within my power to ensure that my mental health was sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d hit rock-bottom and I was going to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on a quick Google search I discovered this website called Pathway To Happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was quite incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unforunately I never ended up completing the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally speaking, I think I was too young to understand it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I&amp;rsquo;d also read a number of books that helped me better understand my depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, this book about learned helplessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which described depression as a symptom based of optimism/pessimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my enlightenment I remember trying to explain these ideas to my ex, and she immediately shut them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I reached the end of the book that it advised not to introduce these ideas to someone who already had severe depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it&amp;rsquo;ll merely make them more pessimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-resolution&#34;&gt;The Resolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/22-07.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Resolution&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really glad I wrote this, because it&amp;rsquo;s helped clarify a lot of things within my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, what I need to do moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I tend to write these articles over two week periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began retaking the Pathway To Happiness audio course as soon as I started writing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s been tremendously wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really helped change the way I think and feel about life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could say that my obsession with her became my go-to destructive responsive whenever I was feeling down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like my addiction with pornography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was something I&amp;rsquo;d do &amp;hellip;simply because it was an instinctual response to feeling worthless about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than because it had any real meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the reason why my mental health has suffered lately is because I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped bothering to be self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which in essence means giving up self-control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also find it&amp;rsquo;s helpful for me to think about how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ve regressed lately - however that isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been heading down the right track for quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been eating healthily, I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping myself preoccupied with my ambitions, I exercise frequently, I even take cold showers for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another really important thing for me (at least a while ago) was to prove that I could be in a functioning relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I think has helped me realise that I&amp;rsquo;m not a broken person, nor bad person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve also come to realise that it&amp;rsquo;s not about proving anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead it&amp;rsquo;s about learning to let go and I feel like that&amp;rsquo;s why I wrote this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can finally let go and look at life from a different point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I&amp;rsquo;m feeling determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And much like my weight lifting, I want to treat it as something that I do regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little nest egg I grow each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 


I want to be able to read this post in the future and be proud of how much I&#39;ve changed. 

To continue my path towards becoming a better person. 

And let go of these feelings that merely hold me down. 

Instead, I want to be happy. 


it&#39;s a cycle I now want to break. 

I feel like it&#39;s something that&#39;s gotten worse lately. 

And I know it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been neglecting my mental health, thinking that it&#39;s merely going to sort itself out. 

One thing I really want to do is get back on the Pathway To Happiness audio course. 

That website introduced me to so many incredible concepts. 

Such as understanding gratitude and remaining neutral with your thoughts.

I want to begin reintroducing meditation back into my life.


For the past few years or so, my thoughts of her had reached a point of becoming managable. 

I wouldn&#39;t think about her for months at a time, only returning to that dark place whenever I&#39;d have a breakdown. 


I don&#39;t know why, it&#39;s just what my brain does whenever I collapse into a pit of helplessness. 

While it wasn&#39;t too bad, 


Now, I suppose what I want to do is go into detail as to how I messed up.

Before then, some context.

As it turns out, 



So many things that went wrong, that it&#39;s hard to say where to even begin.

For starters, I blamed her for not being able to orgasm when we met up.

Which is clearly the worst possible thing you can do to a person. 




A significant issue was the fact that 

She would always say everything was exhausting for her.  

For starters, it almost wasn&#39;t a real, functional relationship. 

Rather, I would describe it as a dopamine hit of disillusion. 




Part of me feels like she didn&#39;t even care.

I remember weeks after our relationship ending she told me that she&#39;d was in talks with her ex&#39;s parents about marriage.

And I was like, what the actual fuck. 

The very man who you claimed took advantage of you sexually weeks into our relationship. 


I often compare to our break to when someone realises that their religion was an outright lie. 








Maybe it&#39;ll help you to understand that I had incredibly limited experience with women up until this point. 







Well, I&#39;ve gotten better. 

I can usually go weeks at a time without any issues.



I would say doing those two things have helped me most. 

You know, spending more time actually doing something, and to define who I am, rather than linger on the past.

And some days it&#39;s impossible.

You literally want nothing more than to breakdown and curl into a ball of nothingness.

Into that destructive world of lust and obsession. 

And I admit that sometimes I do. 

As for her? 

I suppose I wish her well. 

If it&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve discovered in my life, it&#39;s that the only way I&#39;ve ever learnt is by making a complete mess of something. 

And certainly, this relationship was a wake up call in a lot of different ways. 

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth blaming anyone. 

Blame simply leads to more guilt, and that&#39;s something my life needs less of. 

It kills me to say this, but please don&#39;t contact me. 

All I want to do is contact you, but I know it&#39;s just my brain wanting something that doesn&#39;t exist. 

Regardless, I wish you best of luck. 




Of course, I also feel as if I&#39;m a source of trauma for her, which extends the guilt and shame out further.

Which makes me feel helpless. 

And I could honestly write an entire book with this kind of back-and-forth narrative which simply goes nowhere. 

So instead, we&#39;re going to stop and recollect.

      <title>Amelia Snow</title>
      <link>https://juliusreade.com/2017/09/03/amelia-snow/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2017 12:53:26 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://juliusreade.com/2017/09/03/amelia-snow/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways you could say that Amelia was merely a figment of my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, her imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that will be for you to decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, Amelia wasn&amp;rsquo;t her real name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that it ever bothered anyone, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll come to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain, however it&amp;rsquo;s as if she would put you under some sort of elaborate spell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(although it could just be my imagination)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And part of it had to do with the fact that Amelia was special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(she&amp;rsquo;d probably punch you if you told her that, but there was no denying that in my imagination, she was special)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the difficult thing about being special is that it&amp;rsquo;s something out of your control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is to say that &amp;lsquo;special&amp;rsquo; is a perception that one has of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than something you actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I imagine (again) that she merely wanted to be normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I&amp;rsquo;m sure happened under some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I would also argue that almost everyone has an imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I find it difficult to believe that most people treated her as if she were a normal person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I would like to remind you that this could just be my imagination manifesting itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s explore the dissasociation for a tiny moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And view the derangement from up-close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me thinks it was because she embodied everything us young guys wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That broken goddess of sex, lust and mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(as it turns out, us men are somewhat&amp;hellip; unsettled creatures)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is also to say that Amelia was the imagination of man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That image of sex and grandeur we&amp;rsquo;ve all been brought up to worship and devour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as said goddess, she was that perfect gateway to all those awful aspects of our personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personality of man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the world of imagination obscures in the worst of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of those she touched, she suffered much more greatly than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For she was the character she could not bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, because she knew it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-details&#34;&gt;The Details.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/21-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Details.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would I describe Amelia?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as Amelia was merely an extension of my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would involve describing myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 20 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discover this thing called Tumblr and I realise that I can use it as a platform to find women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I thought was pretty cool, provided I&amp;rsquo;d never actually kissed, nor even gotten close to one in my entire life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I viewed it as a challenge, something new and exciting in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, Tumblr is a blogging site with a very dark personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone on Tumblr has issues, whether they realise it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, it was due to my insecurity and complete deprivation of women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And part of me thought it made sense to pursue women with mental health issues, as I also had mental health issues myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, messaging as many girls as I could find in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually meet Amelia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like most girls, I became hopelessly obsessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sex and drugs&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sex and drugs. There&amp;rsquo;s no catch.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember feeling hopelessly giddy at the time, as if I&amp;rsquo;d discovered some kind of gold mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was articulate. Intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I found her very attractive at the time, however my imagination tells me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly, she was the first girl to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because up until then, I experienced nothing but complete friction with women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and I don&amp;rsquo;t blame them, I was a bit of a dick)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we decided to meet up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking from my home, I found her at the train station reading a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it was a book of Plato, (it was either Plato or Aristotle), and I noticed she was rapidly flicking through the pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was incredibly shy and nervous, and she revealed it was because she was autistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And piece by piece, the picture was drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was obsessed with physics and astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had photographic memory, and could draw out entire constellations from memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She revealed that she had a rare disease, and that she most likely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t live beyond the age of 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She claimed to have scored the single highest academic score within her state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was a minimalist, and liked to throw everything away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was violently raped, and had a very serious stalker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cherry was her favourite fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And her breasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For I am a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you are witnessing my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-night&#34;&gt;The Night.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/21-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Why Is Compassion So Hard?&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could call it a special night for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experienced my first kiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost my virginity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I could barely get it hard enough to go in, and she was definitely faking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point she literally blacked out mid-sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(she said it was medical, but I feel like it was anxiety)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However she was my first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was undoubtably special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there&amp;rsquo;s very good reason why I keep referring back to my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I don&amp;rsquo;t think she wanted to have sex with me that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact I know she didn&amp;rsquo;t, because she told me days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she broke down on the tram and confessed to a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She told me that she just wanted to hang out, and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember feeling genuinely shocked at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;d pressured her into it. Maybe she was too shy to say no. Maybe I was too naive to know otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, in my mind I was under the impression that she was all about sex and drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps that didn&amp;rsquo;t mean sex and drugs with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, she&amp;rsquo;d already slept with a heap of other guys recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought I was okay too, you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another level, I felt like there was something much deeper going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps she was doing it to prove some aspect of her personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was the power she was looking for. To feel as if she was in-control of her reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 
Then again, maybe there was something innocent about a naive guy like me.

And she liked the fact that I was willing to believe anything. 

--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is all in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no bloody idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, we still remainded friends and we continued to chat online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, certainly not without it&amp;rsquo;s ups and downs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember we decided to meet up a few more times, and it was&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, not because of the sex, but because it was always weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, she was autistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would sort of sit there and she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say much. In addition, we had very little in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, I think we were fond of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was something about it that was safe and innocent, even though it may have been incredibly dull at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember we&amp;rsquo;d always be super keen to meet up when the opportunity arose every few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet when we did, it was always very anti-climatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were friends without being friends at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think at this point, I realised that the only reason why I liked her was because she was special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was obsessed with this idea of Amelia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone who was smart, sexy and independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in my mind, there was power in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, she probably thought my complete and utter ignorance was cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a sense, I think we both misunderstood each other equally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at that point, I guess I became the role of the journalist in her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would tell me about all the things in her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abusive relationships, the medical conundrums etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of which I don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfort writing about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely because I don&amp;rsquo;t have all the details down pat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-lesson&#34;&gt;The Lesson.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/21-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Lesson.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too sure how to write this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I was going to write about how she convinced me to believe in magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think there&amp;rsquo;s greater meaning to be had from this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely, I want to write about how she influenced me as a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the lessons learnt from her being in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Amelia was an extension of my own insecurities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, wanting to feel special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the only reason why I put up with her, because it made me feel as if I was in on something cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve now come to realise how destructive this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I guess you could say that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to accept myself for who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, your average, hard-working joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who sure, has been traumatised a little here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is still largely confined to the laws of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come to understand that I&amp;rsquo;m hardly special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However instead, that I&amp;rsquo;m a capable, decent human being who has a lot to look forward to in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone who focuses on all the positive and enabling attributes that hold me together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than in doubt at the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t have a monster cock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I think the reason why I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to overcome a lot of my mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is because I&amp;rsquo;m living life to my fullest and to the best of my ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consistently work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend most of my spare time writing, creating and learning new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing absolutely everything I can in my power to be amazing in some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s the standard I hold myself to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s really paying off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m seeing amazing results in my life and sure, part of me desires to be &amp;lsquo;special&amp;rsquo; and unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m successfully suppressing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Amelia behind has been key to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing me to accept myself for who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;liar&#34;&gt;Liar.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/21-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Liar.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t quite noticed yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amelia was also a liar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not entirely, but enough to be branded one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people were smart enough to catch on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally speaking, I was too far obsessed with what I wanted to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partly because I was stuck within that journalist mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I merely wanted to surround myself amongst a host of destructive and interesting characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I could feel as if I was worth something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, there was some kind of very deep intention that was never revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some intricate part of her character that she ultimately kept secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that she would never let anyone touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I do genuinely believe she was autistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I do believe that she was chronically ill (I believe she even developed cancer at one stage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I would say a lot of the lying had more to do with her being shy and wanting to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is to say that a lot of her actions were motivated by the wrong things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which was her own battle to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s why we liked each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some level we both knew we were utterly clueless, and yet we couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite see it from within ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to genuinely describe Amelia, I would say she was a lot like Electra Heart from Marina and the Diamond&amp;rsquo;s second album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She sort of even looked like her, and they both had Greek heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s ironic because Marina created Electra Heart to signify, in her words: &amp;ldquo;the antithesis of everything that I stand for&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet Amelia conveyed all those awful things so perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, because it&amp;rsquo;s the illusive fantasy almost none of us can resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, none other than man himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-details-1&#34;&gt;The Details.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/21-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Why Is Compassion So Hard?&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose there are a few reasons why we no longer talk anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, her highly sexual natural triggers me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;ve come to value my mental health waaayyyyyy too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would constantly post on her Snapchat about getting ready for threesomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a guy with severe pornography addiction and sexual adequacy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise that I don&amp;rsquo;t need an Amelia in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t need a godess to glorify or imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To feel as if I&amp;rsquo;m worth something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise that I too can be sexy, smart and alluring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I can be the Amelia Snow I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think part of what made her &amp;lsquo;special&amp;rsquo; was in my complete willingness to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not in myself, but in her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a result, I viewed her as this holy grail of happiness and desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I knew she was not those things on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as much as my male brain refuses to believe it, sex doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to let go of my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to embrace reality for what is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So goodbye, Amelia Snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hello, Julius Reade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 




I remember it being very cold outside, but we got chatting soon enough. 

She was reading aristotle 

She told me that she had 


And obviously, this is where things begin to breakdown. 

Very broken, very smart and very traumatised.

very talented, very, very desired. 



Let&#39;s just say, that she had enormous breasts. 

She was desired. 

She was short and pudgy. 

She arranged to meet me at my house, which is where we met at the train station for the very first time. 

She was reading aristotle, which is where she revealed she had high-functioning autism. 

I remember she was flicking through the pages of her book quite rapidly.

She said she could read pages within seconds, and that she had photographic memory. 

She was interested in physics and astrology, and later went on to study these things at University.

At one point she described physically mapping out all the stars in the visible universe onto paper. 

I found it quite amazing. 

There were a few other details I would discover that night. 

She revealed that she was terminally ill, and that she most likely wouldn&#39;t live beyond 21. 

She was 19 at the time. 

She also claimed to have had an obsessive rapist. 

In fact, she was originally from Queensland and was staying at her nonna&#39;s house (yep, she was Italian), along with her father. 

She was living in the garage downstairs.


There&#39;s something about mystery that captivates you.

I suppose that&#39;s why I became so obsessed with the break up of my first relationship. 

There were so many unanswered questions that I felt almost paralysed. 


I remember telling her that I would write a book about her oneday. 

Well, that&#39;s absurd now and I&#39;m not quite as enamoured as I used to be. 

In a lot of ways, it was a sad time in my life - a period I never want to revisit. 

However, what I&#39;ve discovered in all this is that I don&#39;t need an Amelia in my life. 





Which I still find hilarious, given she even met my mother at one point. 

She said she was interested in renting a room at my parent&#39;s place.


No one ever truly knew why, and part of you knew that, but then that was why you also wanted to know her. 

To discover the mystery. 

I suppose that was part of her charm - there was something infinitely elusive about her. 

Something magical in the way she acted, as if you were in special company.

As if she were playing some kind of elaborate character.

A hoax?

Assuming she wasn&#39;t lying, then she is most likely dead. 

However there is also a chance she could be alive, so it&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess. 

What made Amelia so interesting is that she would reveal 90% of her life to you, the nitty gritty of her condition.

Yet you would still feel as if you never truly knew her. 

It&#39;s like you met all the people in her life, you saw what was going on - yet none of it felt real.

I suppose I&#39;m writing this today to tell you the story of Amelia Snow. 

At least the version of Amelia that I experienced.

I told her I would one day, so here I am in that very day. 

I still don&#39;t quite know which aspects of her story are true, nor which were untrue.

So I&#39;m just going to paint the picture as I remember it.

Because the picture is what she wanted you to have. 

Or perhaps I was self-seeking in my desires. 

Hell, I think we all were. 







Of course, I still wonder how much of it was my imagination - making assumptions about the world as if glitter were gold. 

Am I just making this up? 


Because while we idealise the world as this pool of dopamine.

In reality, humans can only take so much. 

But no. Men always want more. 




There was something destructive about my relationship with Amelia.

Largely because all the relationships I had on Tumblr were destructive in some way or another.

(well, except for my current girlfriend, whom I&#39;ve been together with for approximately 3 years now)

For example, Amelia convinced me to believe in magic. 

Fairies, imps etc. 

I mean, not that believing in magic is a destructive thing.

It was just that level of influence. 

Firstly, it was something she personally believed in. 

She went into detail about how it worked.

Describing her family history, as well as the lore behind it. 

She would tell the most fascinating stories of the most odd encounters. 

I remember she was too shy to tell me at first, afraid I would judge her as being crazy. 

I suppose this tied in with the strong theme of death in her life. 

She would always describe the ways in which she&#39;s tried to kill herself. 

And yet would never succeed, in part due to who she was. 

She would play with redback spiders and not get bitten. 

I suppose I found it fascinating. 

Then of course, I experienced it first hand.

She was over at my house and it was getting late. 

She insisted that she sleep on the cold hardwood floors, with nothing but a pillow.

Even though it was the middle of Winter. 

Of course, she insisted. 

Anyway, a few minutes pass and she angrily tells me to stop it.

Naturally I start giggling.

I mean, I&#39;m just lying in bed sleeping, and I have no idea what she&#39;s on about.

She says it&#39;s because I threw something at her. 

Anyway, I hear a thud and she gets real angry this time. 

Mind you, she&#39;s on the floor, literally shivering to death. 

Eventually I convince her to come join me in my single bed. 

Later she described of a creature that lives in your house and causes havoc. 

Something like a goblin, but I don&#39;t quite remember it&#39;s name. 

Of course, she could have just been throwing her own phone at herself. 

But again, I didn&#39;t mind believing. 

It was my own little fantasy world and I liked that. 

The only thing I hated was that you had to &#39;be of blood&#39; to truly witness these things.

And naturally I wasn&#39;t. 

I suppose part of the insecurity and attachment to Amelia was this idea that I couldn&#39;t be her. 

I couldn&#39;t have sex with her. 

I couldn&#39;t understand her.

And that made me feel as if I weren&#39;t good enough. 

Which made me want her more.

      <title>Why I Disowned My Mother In 2016</title>
      <link>https://juliusreade.com/2017/08/20/why-i-disowned-my-mother-in-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2017 14:23:23 +1800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://juliusreade.com/2017/08/20/why-i-disowned-my-mother-in-2016/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t speak to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t respond to her messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t made contact with her in over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done everything imaginable to keep her out of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I have no shame in my decision, even if it does occassionally trickle into guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of guilt that comes with making any sort of tough decision in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No different to scolding your own child or changing course into a completely different career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a decision which has positively impacted my life for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a happier, more functional person without her in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And quite frankly, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t trade those things for the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;growing-up&#34;&gt;Growing Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/20-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Growing Up&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I feel about my mother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I feel a range of emotions. Most of them negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predominantly, I feel anger towards her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to grab her face and scrape it against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And make her suffer in the same way that I did as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which ironically, I&amp;rsquo;m sure was the same upbringing that she recieved as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I intend to break the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why I need to kill it at the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Chinese way of growing up, your opinions don&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is always right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the point that she would dismiss me when I told her that things weren&amp;rsquo;t okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even up until I was older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which meant there was no point in trying to understand each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor even communicate how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which lent towards the development of depression and hopeless mindsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, it was fair to say that our relationship was toxic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only time we would ever speak was when we were fighting with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which inherently lead to more fighting - as a false means to pretend as if we had some sort of inherent connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting was the way she communicated with most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which attracted those who were either terribly submissive, or were complete assholes who enjoyed to argue and shout back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading to a host of awful men sprinkled throughout my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of volatility that blunts you emotionally as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be fair to say that I never actually had a real connection with my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t love her. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would only tell her that I loved her so that she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get angry at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on some level, children don&amp;rsquo;t really understand love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I inherently developed this idea that love was transactional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the understanding that she was my mother, and therefore I was obligated to &amp;lsquo;love&amp;rsquo; her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an act of loyalty and commitment, rather than as an actual, tangible feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually it&amp;rsquo;s not until we experience our first relationship and actually fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we realise the extent to which we&amp;rsquo;ve been deceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s just life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, we had nothing in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never hung out or talked about our day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t eat dinner together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell, I even cooked my own dinner for a large portion of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, we largely ignored each other - and it was a lot better than putting up with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a one-way relationship based in finance and title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And very little else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;judgement&#34;&gt;Judgement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/20-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Judgement&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose part of me wanted to leave because I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember as a child that I would tell her that I much preferred my other friend&amp;rsquo;s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because she was nicer and wasn&amp;rsquo;t so judgemental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in response, she said that all people are nice when they have guests over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that if I liked her so much, that I should run away and be her child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, she could have listened and tried to understand my suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However that simply wasn&amp;rsquo;t her style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally speaking, leaving her from my life was a sign of power for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately breaking that fragile system of loyalty and control which created this impression of &amp;lsquo;relationship&amp;rsquo; in her mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, in my mind I knew it was all I ruse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that if I pretended to show face long enough, that it would give her the impression that I was loyal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least long enough until I was able to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that as I got older, I found myself being treated more as a stranger, rather than as her own son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable living in my own home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some level, it didn&amp;rsquo;t even feel like home. That safe place where you can just&amp;hellip; be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the walls of my room were always empty, because I knew I was being judged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the primary culprit was that my mother never understood the value of friendship, over the loyalty of family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;rsquo;t understand that the reason why I never took up her opportunities and refused her help, was because I hated her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;rsquo;t understand that friendship made family strong, as opposed to the fickleness of loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you hate someone, you don&amp;rsquo;t care how much they&amp;rsquo;re willing to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll go as far as to let yourself rot, in order to avoid them at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I rotted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I left my mother for one very simple reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was negatively impacting my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I came to the realisation long ago that there is nothing more important than one&amp;rsquo;s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aspect of her personality that impacted me most was the judgement she conveyed in everything she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything she uttered was carefully crafted back-handed comment or criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was never &amp;lsquo;Oh, you did a wonderful job&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was always &amp;lsquo;Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s really great, but you really should have done this instead, and why didn&amp;rsquo;t you do this as well?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That really fucks with a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do it I&amp;rsquo;ll slap you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part is that it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up and god knows how many other lives I&amp;rsquo;ve ruined because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a lot better and I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my language to be more neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to stop the mode of judgement dictating my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you understand how people develop low self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, it meant I wanted to avoid her at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would always murmur whenever she asked me what was going on in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would never tell her how I actually feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was scared and afraid of her judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I learnt to bottle how I feel, and distract myself with video games and pornography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t grow up understanding my emotions, because I never learnt to express them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, she was a dictator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I felt like it was part of the reason why she split with my father (aside from the fact that he was also a deadbeat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wanted full control over me so she could raise me &amp;lsquo;her&amp;rsquo; way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as a child she would tell me that her time was inherently more important than hers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I hate her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;breaking-point&#34;&gt;Breaking Point&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/20-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Breaking Point&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to try and describe the circumstances leading up to leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was like the cold war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship with my mother couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we were living at opposite ends of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we would avoid each other to the point that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t see each other for days, if not much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My entire life revolved around avoiding her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember I would cook this stew that would last me 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so I could stay out of the kitchen, which was situated in the middle of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would always criticise me for not cleaning the kitchen up to her standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So rather than deal with her constant criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and honestly, it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter how much I cleaned, she would always find something wrong)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to let myself rot, and just deal with eating stew every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later I was forced to move upstairs, where I was no longer allowed to use the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I was provided with two hot plates and a fridge that didn&amp;rsquo;t work, which lead frequently lead to food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further complicate the situation, I had a girlfriend who she didn&amp;rsquo;t like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine because she was fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(in a side conversation, she told me that she would look even uglier as she aged, due to the effects of gravity on all the fat rolls on her body)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much so that she eventually decided to ban her from the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I think my mother had a different idea for my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wanted me to travel and explore the world, as well as find a rich, Jewish woman (as she famously claimed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, she even wanted my girlfriend to pay $50 rent for staying in my room over the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the current rent I was paying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just a clusterfuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of it was that she felt disrespected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is always going to be the case when your idea of respect is based on certain expectations of how one should live their life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, she couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand that respect is something you create and nurture out of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than something you demand from someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there was also a fear of leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of it was money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of spending most my money towards rent and bills terrified me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any other friends who wanted to move out - so I felt stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead, it was something I&amp;rsquo;d slowly been planning out for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d buy items here and there on the cheap, and hide them within my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found a friend who was happy to move out with my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on the night before leaving, I gathered all my things and brought them downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially my mother was confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then shocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then she knew that she had fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By then, she knew it was far too late for her to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panic was real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;future-generations&#34;&gt;Future Generations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/20-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Future Generations&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was reading through some old journals, which would detail the agony of her prescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would frequently travel to china for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would write how her lack of presence was like bliss pure bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with my mother and I was happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another crucial reason why I decided to leave was that I wanted to break the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under no circumstances do I want my children to be exposed to that kind of emotional neglect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s part of the reason why I&amp;rsquo;m with my girlfriend, because I know she will make a wonderful mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I want to create a household without judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want everyone to be able to express themselves and tell each other how they feel without judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I believe a strong part of this will involve teaching them how to express themselves healthily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I want to introduce ideas such as meditation early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as teach them strong life values, not by forcing them - but by demonstrating through self-example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember my father telling me that I should never give up in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I really took to heart as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, he then proceeded to give up on something serious a few hours later - which sent mixed messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be that guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I want to do homework with them. I want us all to sit at the dinner table together and work on something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate that we all have a shared responsibility to our personal development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was perhaps the worst thing about my mother - she would preach what she wasn&amp;rsquo;t willing to do herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a side note, I always find it weird when I go to other people&amp;rsquo;s family dinners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because everyone is always so organic and inviting, and it&amp;rsquo;s always a huge culture shock for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s never perfect, but there is no malice or hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone just gets along and can speak their mind and be themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what I hope for my own family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-on&#34;&gt;Moving On&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/20-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Moving On&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kinds of situations are always interesting to think about in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For it&amp;rsquo;s only once you&amp;rsquo;re away from the danger that you begin to question why you did it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely, because you forget how awful it was, and you think that maybe with enough time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things will different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the reality is, it almost never is - which is probably why I will never speak to her again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There simply is no point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, we never really had much at all to begin with at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all a lie that I felt obliged carry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, what&amp;rsquo;s a kid to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live on the streets and be homeless? Sometimes you just don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the hard thing is that she genuinely loves me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However ulitmately, I made the decision long ago that I would value my mental health under all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if that means cutting off my family, then it will not be for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, it was unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people never forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So play as you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 
 

I suppose I&#39;m writing this article to explain why I did it. 

Why I decided to leave my mother, and why I think I probably couldn&#39;t go back.

Certainly, I don&#39;t like her. 

I don&#39;t think I ever have.

I would argue that she&#39;s largely responsible for my depression.

In the way I was treated and brought up. 

We didn&#39;t communicate, at all. 

I didn&#39;t love her. 

It was an intricate system of loyalty more-than-anything, and it was churning me on the inside. 


People do things for all sorts of reasons. 

I don&#39;t think they necessarily know why they do those things, however they do them. 



This is always a tough subject. 

&#34;It&#39;s complicated&#34;.



It&#39;s dissasociation beyond physical and mental posession. 

Of course, I&#39;d like to think humans are merely a product of their environment.

And that you would have done the same too. 

It&#39;s like when you watch documenties about repeat offenders, in particular drug addicts. 

And in your arm chair of comfort, you watch in disbelief as you witness them relapse again and again.

Provided the number of chances and opportunities they were provided to change. 

Well, I don&#39;t blame them.

Because if you were in their exact same position, you would have done the same. 

Certainly, that&#39;s how I feel about disowning my mother. 



Disown is a very strong word. 

It&#39;s intentional dissasociation: a born trait of both killers and maniacs.

HA

I apologise. 

I&#39;m merely glorifying it as a means to entertan today&#39;s wonderful viewer, yourself. 

We begin. 


Aside from that, she takes everything personally. She&#39;s irrational. She hides things from me.

And she thinks she&#39;s inherently more important than everyone else. 



I think that&#39;s how my step-father really helped, as the only functioning father figure in my life. 

When in doubt, I&#39;ll think about all the hard work he put into his craft. 

And that will inspire me to do the same.

The only issue is that he wasn&#39;t

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t grow up religious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t grow up believing in any of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I never quite understood this compulsion for people to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I could comprehend was how silly their beliefs were, rather than understand the bigger picture of their religious experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s what made it so dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I knew of their beliefs, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to drink from that exquisite chalice that made them drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And embrace myself in that feeling of religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which in essence, made me more susceptible to being influenced by religion later on in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all it&amp;rsquo;s light and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a lot of ways, that&amp;rsquo;s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself being transformed by my beliefs and ideas more intensely later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disguised as something completely unfamiliar and ravishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, substituting prophets with the woman in my life, almost recreating an agnostic version of the bible to complete my understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve thankfully dissolved all that, today I would like to write about why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when you think about it, religion is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s what defines our understanding of the world, as well as our behaviours and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter what we believe - we are all still confined to the hope and delusion which manifests from our undying curiosity to understand ourselves, and the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I believe people like myself go wrong, is believing too intensely in this idea of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That one religion must inherently be better than another, based on the facts it aims to represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, believing that my agnostic beliefs were superior above all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When by definition, faith doesn&amp;rsquo;t attempt to be anything more than a mere notion of hope and worship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in an ultimate twist of irony, find yourself becoming more religious than the people you criticised internally as being religious, in this holy search for &amp;lsquo;truth&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not as a means to discredit others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to reinforce what we believe about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a perpetual cycle of tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, entirely unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-a-temple&#34;&gt;What Is A Temple?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/19-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;What Is A Temple?&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin our understanding, I want us to focus on this idea of the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how it relates to every single one of us, regardless of our faith or lackthereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;re all aware, certain faiths construct churches to spread and congregate their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a sense, we all do the same thing in our minds in regards to our ideas and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worship them, as well as glorify (or demonise) them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on a very basic level temples are places of worship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are places for us to cherish and embrace the ideas which we hold to be sacred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, they are places for us to cultivate and develop our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you think of the mind as a structure, we all have thousands of different temples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representing different ideas and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each one of them, a reflection of our understanding of what we find important in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these temples are quite large and influential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others are quite small and insignificant, meaning they have less influence on our behaviours and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many on the other hand simply don&amp;rsquo;t exist, because we have yet to have that idea or belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, our seemingly non-existent temple on 3rd century peanut farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably just&amp;hellip; won&amp;rsquo;t ever happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size (and existence) of our temple depends on how much time and effort we spend cultivating and embracing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my second point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s important to note is that these temples aren&amp;rsquo;t pre-existing structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that beliefs don&amp;rsquo;t just appear out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We construct these temples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We construct and reinforce them with our thoughts, our time and our worship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reinforce them each time we feel a sense of insecurity, and in every blink that subconsciously defines our experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We develop them and support them, not only with our words, however also with the thousands of other beliefs we have in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are an extension of us in every single way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these beliefs may have been created out of our control as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However that is not to say that we ultimately do not have responsibility, nor function over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;worshiping-the-wrong-temple&#34;&gt;Worshiping The Wrong Temple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/19-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Worshiping The Wrong Temple&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, not understanding these ideas surrounding our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is where a lot of people go wrong with their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s learn and hopefully change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand how we construct (and worship) these temples in our mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they can explain a lot about the behaviours and irrational thoughts we exhibit on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, once we master this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can control what we believe, as well as how we feel about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do people struggle so much in this regard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, this is by design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something we&amp;rsquo;ll get into in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the aim of this article is to help you better understand how we create these temples of belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as how we can dismantle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately like all things in life, the medium isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temples can be empowering, just as they can be destructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s important is our ability to control them, and construct and deconstruct them at our will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which like all things, is something you learn with time - no different to creating harmful beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like most things in life, is something most of us won&amp;rsquo;t get around to until completely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i.e. construct a temple that ruins our life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, many of us construct temples which aim to set false expectations of reality, or which dictate our self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temples based on relationships that aren&amp;rsquo;t what they seem, or on paradigms of addiction which merely hold us ransom to our senses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally speaking, I&amp;rsquo;d constructed this incredible temple based on the experience of my first relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which by design, was greater than anything else I&amp;rsquo;d ever constructed (welcome to the land of love).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once that relationship had ended, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite know how to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My feelings of leaving were conflicting with this temple/belief I&amp;rsquo;d constructed in my mind, which represented our relationship as the greatest thing ever devised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the point that I&amp;rsquo;d considered my temple to be a source of truth, preventing me to let go of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I knew I wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually happy in that relationship, and that it was toxic to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspite of the fact that she was no longer there in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand that this temple was merely a fabrication in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is what makes our beliefs so powerful - they&amp;rsquo;re essentially what define our reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is also to say that humans are inherently religious creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, leading us towards these states of delusion and denial, in an attempt to cope with the conflict we have between &amp;lsquo;reality&amp;rsquo; and our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is why the process of deconstructing these temples can feel as if we are destroying an inherent part of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if we are losing part of our reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we are essentially destroying the structure that we spent so long supporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And is the reason why most people never move on, because they find that pain too difficult to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the same reason we are all afraid of death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is funny, because none of it is &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; and the pain is merely pre-conceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except it&amp;rsquo;s not funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;temples-are-tough-business&#34;&gt;Temples Are Tough Business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/19-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Temples Are Tough Business&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temples are hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;rsquo;re not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we must understand about temples/beliefs is that we have complete control over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem most of us face is that most of us design these temples (usually subconsiously) solely to be worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We design them to be one-way negotiations in an attempt to cultivate delusion, rather than something we can truly connect with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scary thing about these kinds of temples, is that we often don&amp;rsquo;t even realise we&amp;rsquo;ve created them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We enjoy the feeling of worshipping these temples so much, that we completely neglect the process that went into constructing them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we become so desperate that design these these temples with all kinds of traps and defenses in order to ensure that they cannot be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making us feel utterly clueless as to how we should respond, once we realise how destructive they have become to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the monster we must address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, in building our temples, we created guards and defense measures to ensure it&amp;rsquo;s safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is almost inherent, given people usually build temples in times of need and desperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, I suppose what I&amp;rsquo;m getting at is that there are different ways we can construct our temples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that ideally, these temples should be places of understanding and change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not of dictatorship and delusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structures not designed to replicate &amp;lsquo;truth&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But designed to be a a reflection of the processes and behaviours in our life, rather than on faith or beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While beliefs are important - they don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily facilitate anything to the extent that processes and routines do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Article about routine --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you could also argue that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t glorify our beliefs at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I would heartily agree, I would also argue that for most people in modern society, it&amp;rsquo;s entirely unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at the very least, you may as well construct something benign, or that facilitates your goals and achievements in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when we invest in our temple, we invest in the behaviours and feelings that our temples promote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what gives us the power of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In dismantling our temples on the other hand, what we are truly saying is that we want to return that power to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To return to a state where we don&amp;rsquo;t feel obligated to believe in one particular idea or thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to be free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dissolving-our-temples-and-constructing-new&#34;&gt;Dissolving Our Temples And Constructing New&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/19-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Dissolving Our Temples And Constructing New&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we believe in something so intensely, we can fail to understand how exactly we&amp;rsquo;re reinforcing these structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only because we&amp;rsquo;re in denial, but because these temples have been designed not to be dismantled, let alone understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for better or worse, it is a process that can take years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally, years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there&amp;rsquo;s a method that can help us bypass all this
(although it will still probably take us years, however it is also much easier to navigation through)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where we won&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about dismantling these indestructible temples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely, we are going to reverse engineer the process and learn to create new temples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know that resistance you feel when you try to learn something new and unfamiliar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the reason why we find it so difficult, is because we&amp;rsquo;re essentially constructing the beginnings of a new temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why it&amp;rsquo;s difficult is for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, many of us go in learning something with no plans or designs of what the end result should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if we do, that is not to say that we have an idea of what our temple will look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know if we&amp;rsquo;re going to hate this temple (for example, I dislike my temple for sports trivia) or even if we&amp;rsquo;re going to be able to build it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So often we just blindly do something until it sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I stated earlier that it&amp;rsquo;s much more constructive to build temples based on processes, rather than beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because these temples can help us facilitate in the construction of other temples, based directly on our behaviours - rather than something more abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to directly dismantle our harmful temples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we need to do is invest in creating new, more powerful temples - and naturally our harmful temples will dissolve as we place less attention and focus on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it means becoming comfortable with that unfamiliarity and uncertain that comes with temple building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because guess what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning new things is always awkward and hard, but the smart ones learn to embrace that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it means finding new processes and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And honestly, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the only thing we&amp;rsquo;re interested in is the process of learning, rather than what we&amp;rsquo;re learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which can only come from from hard work, imagination and ambition - things which temples do not provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything that empowers you to want to become a better person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often where people will go wrong is that they will overcome their addiction, only to realise they have nothing else to go to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merely repeating the cycle and returning to their bad habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these cases, it is because these new temples haven&amp;rsquo;t been created from hard work, so their foundation will collapse at their very knees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;master-your-temple&#34;&gt;Master Your Temple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/19-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Master Your Temple&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a second aspect to this that I haven&amp;rsquo;t quite covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is the aspect of worship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, in understanding how we create these temples, we want to focus on how we worship our beliefs and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify them, and merely observe how we interact with our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it positive? Is it harmful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are questions we must address in understanding how we interact with the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I am of the belief that experiencing (and perhaps overcoming) religion is an unavoidable aspect of the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely, because it&amp;rsquo;s something you first need to experience in order to identify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet once you&amp;rsquo;ve identified it, you then have to face the crushing experience of dissolving it and everything else along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world we should not rely or construct on our temples at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And certainly, living without notion or expectation or overwhelming blief is something a lot of us should strive towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, it forms such a strong part of the human identity that perhaps it is asking too much of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, as long as you have the ability to control your temples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than have them control you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we also have control over the success we create on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 

Of course, most of us don&#39;t have this kind of luxury in the modern world - which means the strategic use of temples is the next best thing. 

Which is to say that we shouldn&#39;t create temples based in overwhelming belief. 

Or necessarily even commit to any beliefs at all. 

Certainly, temples that empower us have their place in life. 


This is often why I spout the merits of routine, because it can help us solidify the process of building helpful temples. 

Through that initial temple you build from embracing routine itself. 


First, we want to find ways in which we can distance ourselves from our temples. 

This usually means not taking our feelings, emotions and thoughts personally.

In essence, this means understanding that while these things feel real, they are merely indicators.

Rather than a source of truth as our mind is trying to tell us. 

-- link to our emotions are an elaborate lie --



The other good news is that it doesn&#39;t have to happen overnight.

Each time you chip away or think less about your temple than the day before, is one step closer .

Often it&#39;s not about making big agreements.

By making many small agreements we can slowly dissolve many of the negative aspects in our life. 

More simply, first we have actions, then we form habits, which ultimately become beliefs.


A temple based in hard work and kindness.  

Or at the very least, not hating yourself or feeling worthless about yourself. 

It could be an ambition, or something you want to aciheve. 

This part is crucial, because it&#39;s transfering our time and energy into developing something more positive.


Secondly, we also want to at the same time, to construct a much more forgiving and healthy temple for us to worship. 


It doesn&#39;t matter what religion people believe in.

Quite frankly, I don&#39;t even think religion itself gives a shit.

What matters is understanding this idea of faith. 

And how it moulds into our interpretation of reality, as well as our understanding the world around us. 

As a medium through which we all attempt to understand the world. 

Because religion has very little to do with organised faith.

Instead, religion is defined by our beliefs - something every single one of us have in common.

The trick is in seperating religion from the common widespread institutions which try to &#39;claim&#39; it.

Because a lot of us can get caught up in anger created from identifying other people&#39;s beliefs. 

When it completely misses the mark on understanding our own spirituality. 

Regardless of what we believe, we all still relate to our beliefs in the same way. 




This also explains why it can be difficult to construct new temples.

For example, when we start a new routine or perhaps even a new hobby.

It&#39;s because there is no pre-existing temple, and so it&#39;s like building a foundation from scratch. 

Instead, it needs to come from other means.

      <title>Compassion Is Masturbation Without The Guilt</title>

&lt;p&gt;Compassion is the process of learning to unconditionally love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, to unconditionally love and accept ourselves for who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A process which we often substitute with dopamine and cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to distract ourselves long enough in the slight off-chance happiness may come our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only to feel empty and hollow inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And much in the same way, confuse masturbation or eating a slice of cake with the inner workings of a viable coping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now obviously, this process of learning to love is an important aspect of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it&amp;rsquo;s a step most of us completely disregard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we opt to chase our fears and insecurities, as well as the dopamine that comes with inhaling our favourite substances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I don&amp;rsquo;t think compassion is particularly hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s something that most of us inherently want to do, provided a healthy environment and supportive peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, where I believe most of us fail is in here (I&amp;rsquo;m currently pointing to my brain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We forget to be compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, we literally forget about compassion as a concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us are so preoccupied with all the stress and negativity in our lives, that we don&amp;rsquo;t give it a chance to enter our mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To grow with it and become it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the reason we don&amp;rsquo;t meditate or choose to calm down when our anxiety strikes - it&amp;rsquo;s just not hard-wired into how we think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we&amp;rsquo;re already halfway there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans naturally tend towards compassion, so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to learn here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that you&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn to consciously think about compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A battle most of us have already lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the stress, responsibility and self-obsession, we forget that guilt, shame and judgement aren&amp;rsquo;t our only options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only because we have consistently resorted to these methods, that we&amp;rsquo;ve solidified these behaviours as the go-to solution to our problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process, forgetting that life is inherently simple, and that we merely overcomplicate things in attempting to  manage the daily complexity of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already though, by reading this article, you&amp;rsquo;ve done more than most to bring this concept to your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is a huge head start ol&amp;rsquo; buddy, if you choose to maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is today&amp;rsquo;s reminder to be compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remain human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-is-compassion-so-difficult&#34;&gt;Why Is Compassion So Difficult?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/18-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Why Is Compassion So Difficult?&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compassion is the sympathetic pity and concern for the suffering or misfortune of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, to have a healthy consideration for those in lesser positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, to think better of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I love about compassion is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t ask or require anything of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s about letting go of the things holding you down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can be free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All it says is, &amp;ldquo;You should go love yourself&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whether life is tough or easy, love yourself regardless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It applies when things suck. It applies when things are great. It applies always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s not to like about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sort of like flossing, it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things we should be doing, yet we don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s we want to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, most of us happen to discover it by chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No different to thinking about someone from high school we haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about, literally ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mind goes &amp;ldquo;Holy shit, I forgot that person even existed!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what discovering compassion was like for me, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some level, we must admit that compassion is also somewhat of a luxury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it may sound like an excuse, compassion is something that a lot of us simply don&amp;rsquo;t have the capacity to embrace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capacity in the sense that we have a million other pressing issues in our mind, racing past our ability to even consciously comprehend them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while compassion is nice, so is paying our bills or ensuring that our children don&amp;rsquo;t spill milk all over the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time simply isn&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue is that in today&amp;rsquo;s dog-eat-dog world, many of us are desperate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a result, many of us also feel as if we cannot be compassionate, because of the kind of nasty competition capitalism produces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ever-shrinking pie dwindles to that of a crumb, and we fight over the scraps of our masters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think a strong side effect of this is that compassion has become more of a response to the standards of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to a genuine effort to care for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a lot of the chivalry aimmed towards women is largely mindless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Us men don&amp;rsquo;t actually give a shit, we&amp;rsquo;re just doin&amp;rsquo; it cause society has set the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a lot of the misogyny aimed at women is no different - we&amp;rsquo;re just doing our best to get that pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is to say that we bank on the expectations of society, rather than do what&amp;rsquo;s truly compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is human priority playing out in excess, along with the modern pressures of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where individuals and companies vying for our attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where compassion has become nothing more than a product, no different to anything else in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like any successful product, exposure is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s expose you to our dear darling - compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the product of your emotions is much more important than the indirect means we spur to create them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We attack at the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reconnecting-through-compassion&#34;&gt;Reconnecting Through Compassion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/18-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Reconnecting Through Compassion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give you to the tl;dr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no easy way to be compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally, you just do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember at Year 10 camp we had to jump off a high platform to catch a bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the first to go and I was absolutely terrified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then my teacher decided to go next and he&amp;rsquo;s like, &amp;ldquo;This is terrifying, how do I do this!?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him that there was no point trying to rationalise it, or strategise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You literally just jump and try your best to catch the bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will it be that easy for you? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it begs to state that compassion is a conscious effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least initially it will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s something you have to think about, and apply to your life and point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this begins with dissolving absolutely everything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t promote compassion in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your points of view. Your thoughts. Your feelings. The people in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, this is a tricky aspect that I can&amp;rsquo;t quite help you with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can bring it to your attention, I can tell you why it&amp;rsquo;s necessary - however only you can make that sort of commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it this way, I disowned my own mother and it&amp;rsquo;s made a world of difference of how I feel about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s about reducing that attrition - all those things in your life which make it difficult for you to forgive and feel compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While also working on consciously producing compassion in your life, piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least initially it helps to focus on how you feel about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is forcin you to have to love others. But life dosn&amp;rsquo;t work if you don&amp;rsquo;t love yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why it&amp;rsquo;s best to think of compassion as a kind of guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple philosophy to keep in your mind, that dictates a standard of how you should feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because at the end of the day, compassion is a process - the process of learning to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how we choose to connect and relate with reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;compassion-is-an-alternative-to-suffering&#34;&gt;Compassion Is An Alternative To Suffering.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/18-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Compassion Is An Alternative To Suffering&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you dive into it deeper, compassion is sort of a blanket statement for a lot of different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally compassion is about forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is about learning to forgive ourselves, as opposed to feel bad for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To smile at the things that make us feel sick, as opposed to repress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To dissolve the narratives in our mind telling us that we aren&amp;rsquo;t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we must forgive others - although it usually helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about how we feel about ourselves - the originator of our feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you really focus on this message of compassion, you realise it&amp;rsquo;s about relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About letting go of the worry in our mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deconstructing all those illogical structures we&amp;rsquo;ve constructed over the years, that we relied on to &amp;lsquo;keep us safe&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the culprit is within us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We trick ourselves to believe our abuse is truly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in reality, many of us feel as if we have no choice but to consciously tolerate our own suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What compassion is saying is that we have an alternative to this abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than hate ourselves, we can learn to love ourselves instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepting the fact that love is a valid option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, the idea that we have an alternative to our suffering is an eerie thought, because in some ways it&amp;rsquo;s to discredit how we truly feel about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s to say that our feelings are wrong, and that our suffering is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you think about it, what we are doing is actually very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s admitting to ourselves that we have control over our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That we don&amp;rsquo;t have to fit the narrative, that we can almost rebel against the things we believe to be truly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression and being sad isn&amp;rsquo;t radical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the courage to overcome it is, because self-discovery is what true revolutionaries do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They question the fabric of their reality, rather than succumb to the pressures defining it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this begins with ourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not trying to appease our emotions through activism or ideology - but removing ourselves from the narrative and choosing our own unbiased path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather, taking control of the way you feel about yourself, and realising what we&amp;rsquo;re ultimately capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However you&amp;rsquo;re afraid, and fear eats away at you - carving itself into your self-perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compassion is here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;losing-compassion&#34;&gt;Losing Compassion.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/18-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Losing Compassion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;m not a very compassionate person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I ever used to be, however it&amp;rsquo;s something that I can tell has gotten worse over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pursuing my goals, I&amp;rsquo;ve taught myself to detach from the people around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I didn&amp;rsquo;t become a complete Hitler, but I strived to protect myself more than I did to expose myself to my own vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind I felt it was the only way to get anything done, which made complete sense at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, I was surrounded by toxic shitheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who did nothing to contribute towards my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And closing up was my way of dealing with that, even if I knew it was hurting me on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the problem is that even though those circumstances have changed, and I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to leave all these people behind - my attitude towards life still remains within hostility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still rely on this hatred to protect myself, which is also &amp;lsquo;protecting me&amp;rsquo; from all the goods in life as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my awareness of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the consequence of this attitude is that I developed resentment towards others, rather than undesrtanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I merely focused on my own point of view and how I was benefiting, which although valid - provided nothing for my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, my response has been to run away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And certinly, I think that&amp;rsquo;s okay - especially if you&amp;rsquo;re running towards something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it doesn&amp;rsquo;t address however, are those long slogs where you have no choice but to endure - and this is where compassion comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the hardest part in this process is that a lot us weren&amp;rsquo;t taught to think this way about ourselves growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually through harsh criticism and judgement, we instead learnt that self-criticism was the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that we don&amp;rsquo;t love ourselves, however it slowly warps us over time, and we leave behind all those positive qualities we had as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probably emphasises the importance of balance, so that we don&amp;rsquo;t entirely lose ourselves within our conquests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing information and human complexity has always been one of the hardest problems for us to deal with, and inevitably concepts such as compassion are going to be lost along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that by consciously thinking about compassion, even in the smallest of ways, we can reprogram ourselves to be the thing we think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that it can become a central part of our lives, even more so than our own focus and determination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I rediscovered compassion again recently, it was pretty incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I&amp;rsquo;d become so detached from reality, that when I read about these concept of compassion for the first time in years, it managed to blow a few circuits in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, self-compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about learning to love yourself, and embracing that to become even more effective as a human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-expectations&#34;&gt;No Expectations.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/18-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Why Is Compassion So Hard?&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the thing I find beautiful about compassion is that it&amp;rsquo;s self-sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No feeling sad or excessively manic at the whim of a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No falling down to find yourself unable to get back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s existence without the pressure, which I think a lot of us are afraid of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To live without out that constant reminder, that constant nudge telling us that something isn&amp;rsquo;t quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we don&amp;rsquo;t quite realise that by not being stressed and by not worrying, we actually provide ourselves with clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only by removing these stresses, can we actually experience a kind of love that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist without the social anxiety or expectation that you&amp;rsquo;re doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, like most things, life is rather unforgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why it&amp;rsquo;s like a cycle - we do bad, we forgive, we do bad, we forgive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you create a complete monster out of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--

People make awful logicians.

One of the biggest logical fallacies we make, and one that has very significant consequences, is this idea that arguments are one dimensional. 

For example, we believe either that someone either hates us or likes us. 

Yet we don&#39;t think in the possibility that maybe it&#39;s because we hate or like ourselves. 




Instead, we&#39;re focused on the result. 

The funny thing about compassion is that it isn&#39;t difficult. 

There&#39;s nothing about compassion that doesn&#39;t make sense. 

It&#39;s literally something that just clicks in your mind. 

Yet what makes compassion so difficult is that it&#39;s an entirely foregin concept in modern society. 

We are not taught to be compassionate, and most companies view compassion as a form of weakness.

Instead, we are taught about responsibility and blame. 

Competition doesn&#39;t breed compassion. 

It&#39;s do or die - and that is something you drill into yourself. 


I suppose a more fundaental question we need to ask is why we forget to be compassionate. 

I think the answer is quite simple. 

Firstly, I think compassion is a state of mind. 

Secondly, our daily interactions aren&#39;t centered around facilitating love.

And through a slow and arduous attrition, we cultivate hatred instead. 

Because we&#39;re so worried about the result, that we don&#39;t really care how we get there. 

We simply do the thing our brains tell us to, and that drives us.

Again, consciousness.

I&#39;ll keep repeating it again, and again, and again.

That&#39;s really the whole point of this article.

To repeat the same thing in different ways, so you can feel confident about compassion.

And furthermore, understand that if I can bullshit my way through this - so can you. 




I suppose what makes it hard is that it&#39;s just a foreign concept in modern society. 

We don&#39;t live in a compassionate society. 

In my head I&#39;m stuck in this world of diminishing promises and brutal competition, and believe part of my humanity died along with it. 

Certainly, even though I knew something wasn&#39;t right with me, I merely thought it was a necessary burden in my pursuit for productivity. 



Of course, this usually only works for so long, until our underlying beliefs kick in and we activate the depression machine on full blast. 

Not days. Not months. Years.

There&#39;s no easy way around it. 

So why does it take so long? 

Put simply, love is a never-ending process and so if we&#39;re going to live for 

But put it this way, if you&#39;re going to be around for at least another 40 years or so, a few years ain&#39;t too bad. 

Buckle up kiddo&#39;, we&#39;re only gettin&#39; started.

      <title>Two Philosophies</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I have two simple philosophies that help guide me through life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;the inconsequential bread and butter of our human experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you can find them useful.
&lt;!--Perhaps they can be of use to you. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I would call them &amp;lsquo;recession philosophies&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophies designed to carry you through hardship, and assist you in overcoming the surreal harshness of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the problem is that the system can no longer support itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means many people are losing out, in particular, younger generations like myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the year 2017 it&amp;rsquo;s literally impossible to find work, let alone be able to afford the opportunities of past generations - such as home ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s only getting worse by the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be fully-qualified, over-qualified, or the best damn technical or cultural fit possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It literally doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter - the work simply isn&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it to a final-stage interview at an amazing company, only to have the position turned down because they were worried they&amp;rsquo;d have to fire me again in three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard, but this kind of lackery requires you to maintain hope under extreme pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, to learn to suffer gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s how having a few fine-tuned philosophies in life can really help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when you embrace the suffering, you become impenetrable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally speaking, I don&amp;rsquo;t take too much notice of these philosophies anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I would consciously think about them in times of desperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However now my brain has been wired to just get shit done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, because I understand that I lessen my human experience by not following these guidelines, as well as reduce what I&amp;rsquo;m ultimately capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, these two philosophies are predominantly designed to help promote achievement, without the resounding guilt or judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Without the resounding guilt or judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because while a lot of us know how to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few of us know how to do it without also developing an addiction or dragging our ego along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be that person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;philosophy-one&#34;&gt;Philosophy One.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/17-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Life is hard, so you may as well make it harder.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first philosophy is about resilience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life is hard, so you may as well make it harder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It relies on this premise that life is inherently hard, and that it&amp;rsquo;s never going to get easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is to say that life will always be sufferable, regardless of which path you take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this philosophy is to highlight this idea that there&amp;rsquo;s no fear or harm in pushing yourself to your limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when life is already hard, making it more &amp;lsquo;difficult&amp;rsquo; for the time being will have literally zero impact on your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So bloody hell, don&amp;rsquo;t be a dickhead and pursue all the meaningfully difficult paths in life, because at least you&amp;rsquo;ll grow from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#YOLO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;cause let&amp;rsquo;s face it, folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of life is pretty fucking awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time we just don&amp;rsquo;t realise it because we&amp;rsquo;re so exhausted, stressed and under pressure, that we don&amp;rsquo;t even have time to process the suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up at 5:45am each morning because the rent is too damn high to live any closer to work, just ain&amp;rsquo;t normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though I&amp;rsquo;m used to it, part of me wishes I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So honestly, what difference is it going to make lifting unbearably heavy weights to point of bodily cramps, or bunkering down for a few hours to learn something useful that may even bore you to death?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There really isn&amp;rsquo;t any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s what motivates you to choose the inherently more difficult path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when you&amp;rsquo;re already bathed in pain, painful choices become easy to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where do most people go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They fail themselves in assuming that some forms of suffering are worse than others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They ultimately cannot understand that working out or trying to better themselves isn&amp;rsquo;t the only thing that sucks in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else sucks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cake you&amp;rsquo;re currently eating sucks, because it&amp;rsquo;s making you unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting and watching TV sucks, because it&amp;rsquo;s making you dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all sucks, and yet people have preference as to what sucks more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose part of this comes down to awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this understanding that life will never get easier, you become aware of the fact there&amp;rsquo;s consequences not only in your actions, however also in your existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that you&amp;rsquo;re always going to pay, one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose the &amp;lsquo;easy&amp;rsquo; option, you essentially lose out in gaining any insight into the human experience - which is a form of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet if you choose the &amp;lsquo;hard&amp;rsquo; option, you still have to suffer to claim your reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suffering in both cases is exactly the same, because the consequences are equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when everything in reality sucks equally, your experience becomes dictated by time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is to say that as long a you commit your time to suffering meaningfully, you&amp;rsquo;ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key point here is that by normalising your suffering, you normalise the choices in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it allows you to begin viewing life in terms of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than with doubt or fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of viewing something as a challenge, it merely becomes another task dictated by choice and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, ey?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more fundamental level, this philosophy is about choice and embracing the cause and effect of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, it helps me tremendously when I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like working out, or I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a bit lazy in the haze of depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helps rationalise the challenge, pressure, ambition and stress I put myself under each day, without throwing the baby out with the bath water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;philosophy-two&#34;&gt;Philosophy Two.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/17-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Everyone experiences and goes through the same thing.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second philosophy is quite similar in what it aims to achieve, although it approaches the issue from a different angle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Come to think about it, I feel like these philosophies are quite nhilistic, though I&amp;rsquo;m certainly no philosophy literature whiz-bang.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone experiences and goes through the same thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a counter-balance to the first philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it&amp;rsquo;s essentially saying is that everyone suffers and experiences the same kind of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, that there is absolutely nothing special or unique about you, what-so-ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that everyone experiences happiness, sadness, guilt, shame and everything else inbetween.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the same relative degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all feel that same relative level of anxiety when we approach an interview, or ask a stranger out to a date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all feel that initial lack of dread when the thought of having to workout pops in our head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all want to binge on dopamine and escape from reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re all inherently the same, and we all experience the same bullshit in trying to achieve greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that&amp;rsquo;s truly different is in how we choose to react, and that&amp;rsquo;s what this philosophy is trying to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This philosophy is tremendously helpful, because it aims to dissolve what you think and feel about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And help you realise that your emotions, your feelings and your understanding of the world isn&amp;rsquo;t inherently special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And therefore, aren&amp;rsquo;t a real threat or influence on how you decide to live your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, what it&amp;rsquo;s really saying is that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take your feelings, thoughts or emotions personally, because dey r knot reel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, allowing you to push through those difficult feelings as something external, not internal to who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, everyone is normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which a lot of people take to mean average, however that&amp;rsquo;s only assuming that you think you&amp;rsquo;re special (assuming you take an optimistic approach towards this quandry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead, it highlights this wonderful idea that to be normal, is to have the opportunity to grow and become great.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It embraces this notion that everyone is normal and that from there, they decided to become something more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same, normal, fucked-up, retarded, fundamentally flawed human being, all trying and failing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it denotes the imporance of hard work, as well as embracing your own responsibility to dictate our success in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is what allows us to truly understand that life is an level-playing field, relative to our position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the only thing stopping you, is your lack of willingness to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;le-close&#34;&gt;Le Close.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/17-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Everyone experiences and goes through the same thing.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, life is hard and everyone experiences that same hardness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It acknowledges that every one of us faces the same challenges each day, and that we have choice in how we choose to deal with those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bon appetite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--

Not that anyone really thinks about their own personal philosophies, nor adopts the philosophies of others. 

It&#39;s just something you tend to discover when you try to put into words what motivates you and makes you tick. 

--&gt;

&lt;!-- 




I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the personal philosophies I follow in my life, because they&#39;re something I rely on heavily.

Of course, previously I&#39;d always thought that personal philosophies were bullshit. 

To me they were meaningless preamples that had no value, beyond a temporary confidence boost that would fade as quickly as it had arrived. 

In retrospect I realise it&#39;s because I hadn&#39;t discovered any philosophies that were truly personal, nor applicable to myself and the challenges I was facing in life.

Which is to say that these two philosophies may not be applicable to you. 

Both of these philosophies relate to each other in different ways. 

The two philosophies I live my life by are:

&#34;Life never gets any easier.&#34; 

&#34;Everybody goes through and experiences the same thing.&#34;

Okay. 

I get it.

You&#39;re probably as completely underwhelmed, just as I am right now. 

And trust me, it sounded a lot cooler in my head, but 

I&#39;ll explain the significance of these philosophies, however first I want to talk about what philosophies are and how to make the most of them. 

Before then, just a really, really quick primer on what philosophies are and how I use them.





### Philosophy #1: Life Never Gets Any Easier

![What Are Personal Philosophies?](/img/blog/07-01.png)

This is probably the philosophy I rely on the most. 





### What are personal philosophies? 

![What Are Personal Philosophies?](/img/blog/07-01.png)

I rely on my philosophies 


When I&#39;m in a difficult situation, I can rely on these two philosophies to provide me with confidence in my choices. 


It can help to think of personal philosophies as simple reminders. 

Nothing more. Nothing less. 

You don&#39;t have to live your every, single moment according to a philsophy .

Persoally 


A couple of weeks ago I was hanging out with a friend in the city.

I usually enjoy these catch-ups because it usually devolves down into a prolonged pseudo-therapy session of anxiety and self-angst, where we usually exchange trumatic episodes from our lives.

In addition, it proves I&#39;m not a complete social recluse, as I extend my frail hand towards the door knob leading to the front door - cowered in complete fear.

Regardless, we were talking about our lives and discussing what personal philosophies we live by, and I managed to come up with two different philosophies that really help me get through life.

Which I will obviously reveal soon. 



I don&#39;t really know what to think of philosophies. 

I think part of the problem is that they&#39;re inherently personal. 

While it&#39;s not something a lot of us think about, adulthood is an important part of growing up. 



I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot lately.

About what it means to becoming this thing that is expected of people, as if it&#39;s some kind of natural progression we&#39;re supposed to embrace. 

Certainly, the idea of becoming an adult is silly.




It&#39;s an attitude we have. 



What it means to be an adult. - Be an adult 95% of the time.  My main definition is that it means to do everything your power to better your children. It means improving yourself and being all the traits you’d like your children to be. It is a self-realisation that your future generations are more important than you are, and that you must do everything in your power to support them - even if they aren’t alive yet. Most people don’t have this realisation until after they have a girlfriend, or until they actually have a child. The smart ones figure it out early. Of course, I wasn’t that smart and I figured it out waaaaaaay later. 

Responsible adults pursue success. That is an important fact to consider. 


I have two very simple philosophies in life.

&lt;!-- 
Mental Illness Has Always Been A Problem Of Emotion
Your emotions are an elaborate lie. 

--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental illness has always been a problem of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We either feel too much, too little, or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, many of us end up losing context of our emotions and falling into the wonderful world of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A glorious realm where nothing makes sense, and making poor, somewhat regretable decisions seems so damn right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are many different ways we can end up losing context of our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our emotions can encapsulate us to the point that we no longer feel like functioning as responsible, productive adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, choosing to live in a kind of volatile, caustic bubble dictated by reaction and insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, people can feel so little that they no longer know how to feel at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning into gullible, easily persuaded guinea pigs, as they chase trends in a desperate attempt to feel absolutely anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, when you lose context of your emotions, you lose your ability to control yourself and act within your best intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact when you think about it on a very basic level, life is nothing more than a game of managing emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve and create change&amp;hellip; or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, that&amp;rsquo;s why I believe it&amp;rsquo;s possible to prevent burnout from excessive effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can feel the right amount of emotion and sustain that, while also maintaining your drive, then you can just about achieve anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Obviously it&amp;rsquo;s not easy, but we&amp;rsquo;re not here to do easy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the simpliest way to know when we&amp;rsquo;ve lost context of our emotions is if we feel unable to change how we feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which often takes place in moments of intense hatred or sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where we feel so utterly convinced that what we&amp;rsquo;re feeling is permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causing us to no longer question our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, eating an entire block of chocolate was totally the right thing to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, part of what makes these emotional reactions feel so real is in how they can suddenly overtake us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if ignited by a spark, engulfing us in flames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, these emotions don&amp;rsquo;t just appear out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re constructed over a number of smaller agreements that we gradually create into a gargantuan, complex agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An agreement so complex and insane, that it makes us feel trapped within our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, because the complexity makes us feel clueless as to how we can dismantle the hundreds of smaller agreements that we&amp;rsquo;ve created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And which all reinforce each other, turning us into silly putty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s often the reason why it&amp;rsquo;s too late to control our emotions once we have an episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the stage has been set, and you&amp;rsquo;ve been cast as the crazy, old white man with shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many ways we can approach this hivemind of complexity, today I want to start simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to explain what emotions are, as well as why they&amp;rsquo;re not so scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, to provide you with context as to what your emotions actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you don&amp;rsquo;t feel so silly or hopeless the next time you find yourself &amp;ldquo;triggered&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it all begins with a simple analogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;emotions-are-like-traffic-lights&#34;&gt;Emotions Are Like Traffic Lights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/16-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Emotions Are Like Traffic Lights&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this analogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly because I came up with it, but hopefully it clicks with you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I absolutely promise it&amp;rsquo;ll be more infectuous than the chlamydia currently growing inside you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, emotions can be thought of as traffic lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic lights, for the unaccquianted, are those red and green lights you see at intersections, which tell cars whether they can turn or move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingenious. I know, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though when was the last time you actually sat down to think about traffic lights?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if so, it probably isn&amp;rsquo;t something you consciously and frequently think about (unless if it&amp;rsquo;s part of your work, or is an actual hobby of yours).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, no one really thinks about traffic lights all that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re simply there. At the intersection. Doing their thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason being that you have this intrisic understanding in your mind that they&amp;rsquo;ll simply work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No different to the electricity flowing through the city or the water running through the pipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in most cases, they usually do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So rather than think about traffic lights, you&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking about this person you have a massive crush on, or some deep and meaningful topic like post-modern existentialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your mind, this is how life is supposed to be - and that&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I would largely agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet what happens when the power goes out and the traffic lights stop working?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if you&amp;rsquo;re driving on the road, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably start taking notice of the cars around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you reach an intersection, you&amp;rsquo;ll realise that the traffic lights aren&amp;rsquo;t working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now most people will continue to drive, in the process communicating with other drivers and being cautious, in the hope of getting to where they need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though they realise they&amp;rsquo;re in a pickle, they also understand that it&amp;rsquo;s important to safely get to their destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So rather than freak out and decide not to drive at all, they instead understand that by taking things slow and being mindful of what they&amp;rsquo;re experiencing, they have nothing to worry about, no matter how tough it may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, they&amp;rsquo;re prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However these are not all drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some who shut down, who feel afraid, who feel unprepared - and who choose not to drive to get to where they need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people are us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sending-the-wrong-signals&#34;&gt;Sending The Wrong Signals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/16-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sending The Wrong Signals&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, our traffic lights are fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life has tinkered with our emotions - and now nothing is working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bad place to be in, however let&amp;rsquo;s explore it further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we compare our emotions to traffic lights, then there really are two states our traffic lights can be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the example above, the power can be cut off and they can stop working entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is comparable to feeling too little at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, they can be malfunctioning and sending us the wrong signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is comparable to feeling way, way too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, a lot of us tend to fluctuate between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the traffic lights are off and not working, it makes us feel confused and helpless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do, because our emotions aren&amp;rsquo;t indicating what we should be feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is what makes us feel empty and alone, affecting our motivation and general will to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary when we are feeling too much, too much sadness or too much anger (and even happiness can lead to delusion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our traffic lights can malfunction and send us mixed signals, telling us to go forward when we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, or turn into incoming traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is how accidents, disasters and self-harm begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully there are solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I like comparing our emotions to traffic lights is that when you think about it, they cannot necessarily prevent us from moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, they may be telling us not to move forward - however that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we can&amp;rsquo;t just put our foot down on the pedal and zoom ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now arguably this can be a poor idea, especially if the traffic lights are working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in times of a crisis, we must learn to think for ourselves and understand when we can or cannot ignore our traffic lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably it&amp;rsquo;s only because we put faith into our traffic lights that we feel unable to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now obviously it&amp;rsquo;s scary questioning our traffic lights, especially when we may have relied on them for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However learning not to take them personally, and understanding that they are external to our ability to change is one half of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to actually do that is the other half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reinterpreting-our-emotions&#34;&gt;Reinterpreting Our Emotions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/16-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Reinterpreting Our Emotions&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to externalise our emotions is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, we must also understand why our emotions are important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as how we can embrace them, and our feelings as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, our aim should be to achieve a balance so that we don&amp;rsquo;t feel too little or too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provided that suffering is largely caused by a disparity in emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use our emotions to know when it&amp;rsquo;s okay to feel safe, when we should be afraid, when we should feel guilt, amongst a whole range of other feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when our emotions stop sending us the right signals, we can actually begin to think that there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking it personally and downing three bottles of wine to dampen the mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, emotions can be thought of as specialised indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like traffic lights, they&amp;rsquo;re designed to guide us towards making the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Feeling sad? I know, I&amp;rsquo;ll adopt an optimistic attitude and refrain from pursuing my addictions, because it will make me feel worse later&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that a lot of us didn&amp;rsquo;t learn how to make that right decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the narrative went a little more like: &amp;ldquo;Feeling sad? Well maybe if I starve myself and get really skinny, I&amp;rsquo;ll like, feel better about myself?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our own interpretation of our emotions, we began reinterpreting the meaning of those green and red lights, beyond which they were originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the human curse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take reality so personally that we no longer become human anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the big difference between driving a car through a set of broken traffic lights, and the conscious human mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that the immediate urgency or danger of neglecting our emotions does&amp;rsquo;t become apparent until much later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily risk death when we ignore our emotions or proceed with a pessimistic mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, the feedback is small if not neglible - unlike winding your body around a tree at 100km/ph due to your vague drowziness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that these problems or reinterpretations arise over time, as we slowly reinforce these behaviours into our mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s never the first time you told yourself you&amp;rsquo;re worthless. It&amp;rsquo;s the 20,000th time that finally puts the nail in the coffin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s the idea that through small agreements, we create large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;seeing-through-the-red-and-green-illusion&#34;&gt;Seeing Through The Red And Green Illusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/16-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Seeing Through The Red And Green Illusion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful thing about our emotions is that they&amp;rsquo;re merely indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is to say that they&amp;rsquo;re nothing more than a simple feeling, until we provide it with context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny how context can dramatically change the meaning of what we&amp;rsquo;re interpreting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we believe someone is innocent then we can let them get away with anything, however if we believe they&amp;rsquo;re conspiring against us, then we ensure that they feel hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the truth is, meaning and value are created through our own beliefs and interpretations of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the overall scheme of things, this provides us with two options moving forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can either detach our emotions from our beliefs and expose them for what they are - indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, we can change our interpretations so that they no longer provide our emotions with meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, to no longer take our emotions personally, or to change how we feel about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first angle provides us with immediate results, while the second method provides us with long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both are nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why there&amp;rsquo;s a third option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to work with our emotions, we can stop listening to our emotions altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this sounds quite radical, in practice it promotes basic self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than listen to your emotions, you instead observe your emotional state and refrain from getting involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works because it keeps you out of the fight. It allows you to truly see yourself for what you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assist this, I often find it helps to imagine yourself stepping away from your body, as if you&amp;rsquo;re watching yourself from a 3rd person point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because trying to communicate with malfunctioning traffic lights doesn&amp;rsquo;t help. They don&amp;rsquo;t actually care about you or have your best interest in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t even realise you&amp;rsquo;re there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re simply malfunctioning in their own world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why you need to get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;don-t-think-and-rationalise&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Think And Rationalise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/16-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Don&#39;t Think And Rationalise&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traffic lights, our emotions are reinforced by good behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The better you behave, the better our emotions will function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the otherhand, trying to talk to yourself out of your emotions, at least I find, doesn&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you end up engaging with yourself from a 1st person point of view, which merely solidifies what you&amp;rsquo;re feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking your way out of your emotions also usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the act of thinking engages with your beliefs which merely reinforces and makes you more attached to your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observation on the other hand is designed to detach yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect to consider is how we can best gauge reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not for our emotions, then what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When traffic lights go down, we still have other references to navigate through reality, such as our vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is no different to when our emotions go haywire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar with when we lose sense of our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this explains the idea behind not taking things personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take something personally, is ultimately to provide your emotions with power and to legitimise them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which really is to treat the broken traffic light before us as a source of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known quite suitably as delusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s no wonder, because emotion is a very powerful thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the number one tool we use to gain trust and respect, as well as to convey our intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I&amp;rsquo;m sure you already know this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh god, this article is a complete illiterate mess lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to fix it up when I have the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--

They&#39;re certainly more cautious and they&#39;re communicating with other drivers and giving way, however little has changed for them.


Humans are emotional creatures. 



Which means the best way to gain trust is by 



Not that change is easy, which is why most people end up staying in their abusive relationships indefinitely. 

On other side of the coin are people who have remained stationary for so long that they no longer know how to drive.

Which is to say that even inlieu of functioning traffic lights, still would be unable to get to where they want to be. 

Largely relating to people who feel too little at all. 

The worst part is that it&#39;s self-reinforcing.

Most people don&#39;t even realise they&#39;re doing it, and it often reaches a point where they think this is actually who they are - nothing. 

Which is how people end up with a BMI of 800 or develop an incredibly judgemental attitude - these outcomes are reinforced over decades, one thought at a time.

The other consequence of this slow trickle, this gradual build up, is it makes us oblivious to how we got there in the first place.

Because we don&#39;t take notice to how we got there. We simply become triggered and it encapsulates us to the point of no return. 

Of course, I can&#39;t imagine thinking ourselves out of this situation is going to be of much help. 

Which is why we need a few tricks to snap ourselves out of it.




In reality, they&#39;re merely providing us with cues for what we should do. 

Rather than control the car that is us.

&lt;!--
    The Unforunate Layman&#39;s Guide To Addiction
    How I easily manage addiciton. 
    How I Mostly Overcome Triggers
 --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addiction is somewhat of an irreparable subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not something we can necessarily fix, nor assume will go away like the ending of a bad dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s not to say it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to overcome addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just that for most people, addiction is a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This complex state of mind that embraces us with our every thought, that comes and goes with the seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for most people, that&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the very definition of an addict is someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t learn from their mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who either consciously or unconsciously pursues the same pattern again, and again, and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not because they are incapable, but because they&amp;rsquo;re not truly decided on who they are or want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t quite know what they want, because they don&amp;rsquo;t have the courage to understand what they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s in this sense that everyone&amp;rsquo;s an addict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we&amp;rsquo;re cowards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as every single one of us is receptive to dopamine, addiction will always be a battle to be fought daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most typical &amp;lsquo;addicts&amp;rsquo; will pursue their addiction several times a day, whether it be through the general thought of craving, or through the tantamount pressure crushing their ability to remain focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-addicts on the other hand are no better - they just don&amp;rsquo;t quite know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally situated are recovered addicts - the battlehardened minority who understand what they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of people who are focused and who aren&amp;rsquo;t distracted by food, drugs or your predetermined vice of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They know how to manage their problems, and avoid their cake too. Who are indeterminably immune from their own scars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While addiction is obviously both a physical and mental state of mind, a strong part of it is also cultural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every single one of us is part of this awful, dwindling arrangement called society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means it&amp;rsquo;s essentially impossible to escape the dopamine-wielding influences around us, from the advertisements to the beliefs of society coluding in our head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling us to be pursue something we&amp;rsquo;re not - a craving beyond our own senses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other aspect is the standard society sets for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are unaware that their being overweight or unambitious is a product of their addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because society has normalised these things (along with consumption) as a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not merely as an option, however as a default choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately for most people, it&amp;rsquo;s a choice that&amp;rsquo;s grabbed them left-right-and-centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I want to address the heart of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that you stop being addicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of course, begins with a simple method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-we-fail-to-control-our-cravings&#34;&gt;Why We Fail To Control Our Cravings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/15-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Addiction Isn&#39;t Complicated&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about knowledge is that it&amp;rsquo;s largely useless if it&amp;rsquo;s incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can know 95% of how something works, like how to perform 95% of heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However without that last 5%, those nasty edge-cases can really screw you over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the reason why most people struggle with their addictions is due to not being aware of that last 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They know all the things that trigger them, even what they should do when they have an urge - yet they can&amp;rsquo;t quite seem to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this article is to help you find that 5%, or at least close to, so you can make progress with your addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I recently discovered my last 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I can happily say that it made a fool out of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the takeaway from this is that humans often learn by chance, and that I got very lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m sharing what I learnt today in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that humans severely overcomplicate addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We overcomplicate it with our doubts about our potential to recover, and with our rationalisations of how we should aproach it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It interferes with our ability to think, as well as our ability to act with our best intentions in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the reason why we overcomplicate things is because we&amp;rsquo;re clueless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is to say that we don&amp;rsquo;t quite know what the outcome of our actions will be, because we don&amp;rsquo;t actually know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, doubt and action are two ends of a competing spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have enough understanding and faith in your own actions, it completely eliminates all doubt and indecision in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet part of the problem is that before we can even doubt ourselves or even take action, we&amp;rsquo;ve already shut our brains off and left the room to have another slice of regret pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is the decision our brain has made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we can switch our brains back on again and fight back - more on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose what I mean to say is that even though we have a general idea of what we should do, most of us have difficulty making it actually work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost like we&amp;rsquo;re aware of the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re not actually aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to have the comparison to meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know meditation is about focus and emptying all the thoughts in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However to actually do it, in our actual head, isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the importance of method and pracice comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method and practice is that last 5% we don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I am going to explain how to stop your urges from getting the best of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-s-how-you-prepare-yourself&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s How You Prepare Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/15-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;It&#39;s How You Prepare Yourself&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons why this particular method works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason is because it does, and the second reason is because you&amp;rsquo;ll understand why it works - in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, how dandy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the method is largely irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as their are thousands of different languages, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter which one you speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end goal is communication and that is something that goes well beyond your ability to speak or use words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the idea behind this particular method is to give you confidence and prevent your cluelessness from kicking in whenever your cravings strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only by eliminating your doubts, however also by providing you with the knowledge to know exactly what to do, how to do it, as well as what the outcome will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any effective method, it will rely on your ability to practice and take action, which is a seperate, and very different skill to understanding what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also come to understand that it&amp;rsquo;s a truth most of us discover the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;rsquo;t say I didn&amp;rsquo;t warn you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article explains it a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cross-post-template&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a class=&#34;cross-post-template-title&#34; href=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/2017/03/31/success-is-a-verifiable-system/&#34;&gt;Success Is A Verifiable System&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the reason why it&amp;rsquo;s important to master the method, is that it takes a lot of thought out of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is a HUGE benefit, when you no longer have to think or worry, ontop of actually preventing yourself from urges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which really is to say that we tend to spend more time thinking and worrying, rather than actually doing what is actually necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, overcomplicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s why routine and discipline are so effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They handle your emotions and expectations for you, so that you can simply carry on with your day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So really, all you need to do on your behalf is to commit and actually do the thing you&amp;rsquo;re hoping to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deliriously awkward thing about this kind of logic however, is that it only makes sense once you commit for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, most people end up learning the hard way, or perhaps not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully this method doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a lot of faith or commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because unlike marriage, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier to walk away from an addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--Which is also to say that it is effortless. --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;short-term-plan-long-term-plan&#34;&gt;Short-Term Plan. Long-Term Plan.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/15-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Short-Term Plan. Long-Term Plan.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is the best way to be prepared?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, to create a plan of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very broadly speaking, in order to control our cravings (as well as our general addiction) we will need to plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are two very basic aspects to internal planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are our long-term plans and our short-term plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our long-term plans are designed to provide us with future ambition and hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially they are designed to provide us with reasons as to why pursuing our addiction is a poor idea, at least compared to the alternatives out there - like reading a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future ambition works because our hopes and dreams are a very, very compelling force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;as well as a destructive one, in the world of cynicism and pessimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I tend to find is that most people who even bother considering to seriously overcome their addiction, already have this aspect down pat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far within the article - which means you&amp;rsquo;ve already persevered through a lot of bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It usually takes a very ambitious person to want to tackle their problems, which means you likely already have a few of them sorted out - such as your career or your completely non-existent love life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually where most people fail is in their coping mechanisms, which is what we intend to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, your ability to manage the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a very basic level our short-term plans comprise of the individual decisions we make in our head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. We must think very, very short-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like a clock ticking in the background, these decisions dictate our every move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with our long-term plans is that they are usually inadequate to prevent us from pursuing our urges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;or rather, because we fail to convey them in a way our short-term selves can understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the reason why many people can abstain for a long period of time from their addiction, only to eventually give in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be that guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I clearly am that guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-certifiably-short-circuit-your-cravings&#34;&gt;How To Certifiably Short-Circuit Your Cravings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/15-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;How To Control Your Urges&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now onto the exciting part of the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to effectively short-term plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I like to think of short-term plans as a mechanism designed to short-circuit your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can help to think of short-term plans as a repetitive succession of decisions and thoughts you create in your mind, to guide you away from your cravings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like a disco blinker light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except instead of a succession of bright, flashing lights - it&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of thoughts you create in your mind that say &amp;ldquo;no, no, no, no, no, no&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain how this works, it may make more sense to explain where people go wrong in trying to manage their cravings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, people don&amp;rsquo;t know how to effectively resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the onset of craving comes along (at least for someone who is consciously aware that their addiction is not in their best interest), two things usually happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the person thinks: &amp;ldquo;Oh shit, I really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do this thing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followed by: &amp;ldquo;but I really fucking want to&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason in our heads, we think that&amp;rsquo;s enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think that knowing that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do something is enough to actually stop us from doing it, at least to a point where we can influence and prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, most of us simply leave it to chance and circumstance to dictate the outcome of our cravings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, because we really just want to give in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a lot of people don&amp;rsquo;t understand, is that you have to fight back in your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that fighting back actually works, it&amp;rsquo;s just that it&amp;rsquo;s something that usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur to most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either because they feel like they are fighting back, or that it&amp;rsquo;s pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than leave it to chance, you have to mentally communicate with your brain and tell it &amp;lsquo;No, no, no, no, no, no&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;No, you will not do the thing. You absolutely will not do it at all&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works because it is a conscious attempt to defeat your craving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is where a lot of people fail as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; once in their head, and they think that&amp;rsquo;s enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You literally need to spam that thought, on repeat, again and again in quick succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds stupid, but don&amp;rsquo;t beat it until you try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I&amp;rsquo;d personally failed. I&amp;rsquo;d say no once or twice, then stop saying no because I&amp;rsquo;d assumed that if my brain didn&amp;rsquo;t get it by now, then there was no point continuing to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually this method is enough, however I&amp;rsquo;ll explain some other things that also work well - so you can get a few ideas rolling in your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that works really well is to actually plan exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re going to do in your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is literally creating a plan in your head, and it works because it prevents you from making assumptions about your outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;I am going to click on this web browser tab, then I am going to read this page, then I am going to click on the next web browser tab&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By stating what you&amp;rsquo;re going to do, you essentially commit to doing these things in your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However you have to keep it very short-term, otherwise you create loopholes for yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction, I also like to state why doing the alternative is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, playing on scarcity works well too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;If I don&amp;rsquo;t work on my portfolio now and prioritise getting it done, it means that I&amp;rsquo;m going to be behind. I have so much work yet to do. I must move fast.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I suppose the point is, there is so much you can do - and you have to find what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-doesn-t-start-with-a-method&#34;&gt;It Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Start With A Method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/15-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;It Doesn&#39;t Start With A Method&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one very glaring problem with this guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It assumes a lot about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It assumes that you&amp;rsquo;re me, which you are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that you have your ambitions in order, even your mental health to a large extent - and you&amp;rsquo;re just figuring out how to do the damn thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It assumes that I&amp;rsquo;m not an addict, which we all are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I believe I&amp;rsquo;m close to overcoming addiction, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;m quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times it goes from being the easiest thing for months at a time, to the most difficult thing as I splurge in excess per the hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though certainly, I&amp;rsquo;m a lot better than I used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m usually in control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m usually quite functional and ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my problem is that I&amp;rsquo;m addicted to being addicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m used to, but there&amp;rsquo;s something about overcoming addiction that has me hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if I enjoy the masochistic struggle that ensues from giving in, as well as that final &amp;lsquo;ah-ha&amp;rsquo; moment of no longer craving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I also feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve become so desensitized from the whole process, that it&amp;rsquo;s as if I&amp;rsquo;m no longer an addict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I just do the thing and then don&amp;rsquo;t think about it or crave it for a couple of weeks, simply to see if it gets me addicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which in a sense, almost spurs me to want to do it - which then actually gets me addicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the most boring game of cat and mouse you&amp;rsquo;ll ever witness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whatever you do, it&amp;rsquo;s probably in your best interest to disregard everything I&amp;rsquo;ve written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I play a good word game, but ultimately I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--


Something that actually works, not necessarily because of the method, but because it&#39;s something you have a strong understanding of.

Which is more important than having all the tools and resources in the world. 

You see, the reason why we overcomplicate addiction isn&#39;t because it&#39;s complicated.

Are there people in society who are balanced? 

Of course, however they are a very, very rare breed.

And I&#39;m being generous. 





Enough about that however. 

I&#39;m here to talk about how you can overcome addiction, or at the very least aim to normalise your cravings. 



I&#39;ve found a method that largely works - at least thus far, at the inexperienced age of 24. 

A method that allows you to control your cravings, and get on with life.

It&#39;s actually quite easy. 


It works not because it&#39;s particularly special, however because it helps gap that last 5% you&#39;re likely missing.

Of course, I&#39;ll try and provide some background context - however in my particular case, it was this tiny, little thing I wasn&#39;t doing correctly which caused me to spin out of control. 

Again, it made me feel very stupid once I&#39;d figured out why. 

Though we all have our particular weak points. 


Now, there are a lot of different reasons why this particular method works, however I&#39;ve also come to understand that these reasons are less relevant than the method itself. 

The reason being that understanding why it works won&#39;t necessarily assist you in being able to do it. 

Personally, this guide doesn&#39;t do much to address our long-term ambitions. 

Again, I assume that if you&#39;re reading this article, you probably already have that down pat.

Not to mention, most people tend to struggle with their urges, more than their ability to create hope.

      <description>

&lt;!--
I eat paleo and here&#39;s why I&#39;m not crazy.
Why the paleo diet isn&#39;t bullshit. 

--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the paleo diet is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been eating paleo on and off for approximately five years, remaining entirely paleo for the past two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s brilliant because I&amp;rsquo;m a health fanatic, and it helps me maintain that quite easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m writing this article because of all the mixed, and largely negative ideas of what the paleo diet actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, because of the intense transformation that takes place on someone&amp;rsquo;s face, the moment you tell them you eat paleo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost as if they&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered someone&amp;rsquo;s been inappropiately touching their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--There&#39;s something intense that changes within a person when you tell them you eat paleo. 

In the same sense that there&#39;s a bit of a taboo surrounding the underground gambling circuit or touching other people&#39;s children. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people view the paleo diet as this hilarious market-driven gimmick, that abtains to running around naked, beating people with a club like an ancient caveman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even as the natural evolutional trend to scientology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which baffles me, because the diet makes sense from both scientifically and nutritionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that&amp;rsquo;s aside from the point, because humans will always stoop to the lowest common demoninator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, Trump got elected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think there are two issues at play here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I think we inherently distrust fanatics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, it takes a fanatic to want to do the whole paleo thing in the first place, which really doesn&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because fanatics are viewed as a kind of unholy disease, rather than a source of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially when it comes to health and diets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when everyone has an opinion, yours is always the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, and perhaps most influentially, is the connotation the paleo diet has with the paleolithic period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, here&amp;rsquo;s how it usually goes down when I try to explain the paleo diet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So the paleo blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah blah blah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because once you mention the word &amp;lsquo;paleo&amp;rsquo;, you can literally see their brain shut off and enter into a kind of droopy fantasy-land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every word you speak following that specific word becomes nothing more than biological soup to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, they&amp;rsquo;ve already happily generalised absolutely everything they&amp;rsquo;re willing to know about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ah, that dickhead. I bet he uses a spear instead of fork. Poor bugger.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is frustating because the paleo diet has very little, if almost nothing to do with the paleolithic period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is nothing more than a cheap reference, like what pineapples have to do with apples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and let&amp;rsquo;s not even get started on this word &amp;lsquo;diet&amp;rsquo; which already raises strong suspicion well beyond the scope of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am, hoping to explain the whole paleo thing to you, and why you may not get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I want to go into the kind of lifestyle it promotes, as well as the kinds of people it inherently attracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I promise I don&amp;rsquo;t touch other people&amp;rsquo;s children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;health-fanatic-ewwwwwww&#34;&gt;Health Fanatic? Ewwwwwww.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/14-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Health Fanatic? Ewwwwwww.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose there&amp;rsquo;s a very simple question I would pose to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it such a bad thing to be fanatic about your health?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people think that the whole paleo thing is taking it a bit too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, I think heart disease and obesity is taking it too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the point of difference is that non-paleo folk don&amp;rsquo;t believe that their diets contribute towards these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence the point of contention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, allow me to try and explain why a lot of us paleo folk do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the sake of argument, let&amp;rsquo;s just assume that it&amp;rsquo;s good for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not eating processed foods, excess sugar and meeting all your nutritional requirements surely can&amp;rsquo;t be a bad thing, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cunning Nazi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I want to start off by saying that we don&amp;rsquo;t hate food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love our bread and butter just as much as anyone else, and by gosh, do we think it tastes great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just that we care that little bit more about our health instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which really is to say that we have different priorities about what we believe will make us happier in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us paleo folk believe that being able to function will make us happier in the long run, than having access to the simple pleasures of bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, there are plenty of amazingly delicious paleo dishes out there too, so it&amp;rsquo;s not like we&amp;rsquo;re starving ourselves either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why this emphasis on function?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in my particular case it&amp;rsquo;s two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I just want to achieve my goals and ambitions and get shit done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not being able to function to the fullest of my ability greatly affects my physical and mental health, which trickles down to my ability to pursue my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which when you&amp;rsquo;re already suffering from mental health issues, is difficult enough as is without eating as healthily as possible to regulate how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, it becomes very difficult to do anything, let alone prevent mental breakdowns when you&amp;rsquo;re feeling bloated or your energy levels aren&amp;rsquo;t consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And perhaps, some might argue, poor diets are the inherent cause of depression and  mental illness (look into the correlation between gut bacteria and depresison).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s the why, however the reason behind the paleo diet is so much more pervasive than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this kind of regime attracts a certain kind of person which society largely loathes anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excessively productive, ambitious and highly insecure individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those fucking twats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we love cake just as much as anyone else, it&amp;rsquo;s just we love the idea of becoming a multi-millionaire more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know it&amp;rsquo;s not sexy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s ultimately why the movement was doomed to remain an obscure niche for those who need it to pursue their greed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s part of what drums up this me vs them mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this is why the paleo diet is often compared to religion - as this bohemoth, &amp;lsquo;you shall not pass&amp;rsquo; ideology, where there is one way, and one way only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is true, because in our case, our one and only way is success - and we will stop at nothing to obtain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is nothing we hate more than those more successful than us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel it. You feel it. We all feel it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose there&amp;rsquo;s a fatal flaw in thinking that paleo is about making everyone healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, it&amp;rsquo;s about exploiting those who are unhealthy, in order to be more productive and to beat the competition down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-science-behind-the-paleo-diet&#34;&gt;The Science Behind The Paleo Diet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/14-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Science Behind The Paleo Diet&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what the diet actually is, I suppose there are two points that stand out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first point relates the range of foods that the diet deems appropiate to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the aspect people focus on most, and is perhaps the least important point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other aspect is the macro-nutrient content of the diet - which is ultimately what matters when considering any diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and arguably has nothing directly to do with the paleo diet at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, here is what is wrong with most modern diets, from a macro-nutrient point of view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, most of us are eating too much sugar and carbohydrates, provided our modern lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people believe in this hiliarious concept called &amp;lsquo;moderation&amp;rsquo;, despite sugar being an inherently addictive substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the bastardisation and now wide-spread belief that fat is evil, even though it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary reason why sugar/carbs are bad is because they&amp;rsquo;re an awful source of sustainable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They burn quickly, meaning you must consistently eat more sugar to maintain your energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which in reality, given the inherent lack of self-control most of us exhibit, along with the addictive qualities of sugar, leads to over-eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as excess sugar readily converts into fat (unlike fat consumption, which does not), is a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;rsquo;s ya problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the alternative to a high-sugar diet is to instead rely on a high-fat diet (somewhat related to the process of ketosis), as fat makes for an excellent source of sustainable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does it prevent cravings by making us feel full, however it&amp;rsquo;s also a slow burning source of energy - meaning you don&amp;rsquo;t need to eat as much to feel full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue is that in order to gear your body towards effectively metabolising fat as a primary source of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must ensure that you keep your sugar/carb intake to an absolute minimum, in addition to increasing your fat intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And guess what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most modern diets make this entirely impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are there few modern foods/meals today that are a high quality source of fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However given most staples involve either wheat and rice - you&amp;rsquo;re basically doomed for failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the paleo diet comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s restrictive and that&amp;rsquo;s the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a guideline that allows you to eat high-fat and low-carb, by simply sticking to the foods we consider &amp;lsquo;paleo&amp;rsquo; foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, you also avoid all the other shit like gluten, lectins and phytates - which relates back to our first point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That certain foods are inherently destructive to human biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t explore these ideas in detail, because I feel it&amp;rsquo;s less important (though still very important) than compared to explaining the importance of macro-nutrient intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, if you&amp;rsquo;re eating the right macro-nutrient ratios, then you&amp;rsquo;re going to have success with your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just the paleo diet makes it easier, because it&amp;rsquo;s already built-in and cuts down on making those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;paleo-vs-moderation&#34;&gt;Paleo vs Moderation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/14-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Paleo vs Moderation&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, and perhaps why so many people have come to fear the diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is because the paleo diet stands, quite literally, opposite to the general view of moderation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes against this wide-spread belief in society that it&amp;rsquo;s okay to moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, what it proposes is restriction - which let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, is probably what most of us need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, it&amp;rsquo;s how I deal with a lot of my addictions and flaws, by completely restricting myself from my vices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why should our diets be any different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the reason why things like routine and consistency work so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because humans are inherently emotional creatures that need structure and logic in their lives to function in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need laws or timetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the great irony of the paleo diet is that it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly suited for those who aren&amp;rsquo;t fanatic about their health, as it makes dieting so easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet on the otherhand it takes a fanatic to want to do it within the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why it&amp;rsquo;s easy and sustainable, is because it helps prevent cravings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it takes the choice and anxiety out of choosing what we must eat next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the paleo diet you literally do not need to think or worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is stick to a range of foods, and the rest will sort itself out. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem however has never been with the paleo diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been with the attitude us people have had towards health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, it means that the less crazy you are with your health, the more inversely difficult it will be to become healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only will you be less committed mentally, however the diet you&amp;rsquo;ll be approaching will be less effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due in part to your own self-limiting beliefs of what you believe may work as a diet, in order to satisfy your own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is also to say that if you&amp;rsquo;re not dedicated to your health, then you&amp;rsquo;re going to fail no matter what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the reason most diets fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s like those people who try to lose weight by doing the whole shake thing, yet they also refuse to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s what a lot of people, yet it does nothing to control cravings or even promote future healthy eating choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative simply isn&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-just-works&#34;&gt;It. Just. Works.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/14-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;It. Just. Works.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, there&amp;rsquo;s also a very good reason why people do the paleo diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since eating paleo, I don&amp;rsquo;t crash or slow down nearly as much as I used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up at 5:43am each working day, and I blaze until 9pm at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, yes. I still get immensely bored at work and there are times where I just cbf everything and want to sleep all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly imagine how much worse it would be if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have all this extra energy from my diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after all that, I still manage to find the energy to lift weights at 7:20pm after work, three times a week for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m focused. I&amp;rsquo;m full of energy and my brain is literally go, go, go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know that drowziness you get around 5:30pm on the train-ride home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t get that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the interesting thing is that you don&amp;rsquo;t realise how bad something is until you understand why and become aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember prior to the paleo diet I used to have trouble shitting for years, and I would frequently get mouth ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you just assume that it&amp;rsquo;s normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You assume that this is the normal, human experience and I think this is part of the reason why people distrust the paleo diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re so stuck within our own paradigm, that we don&amp;rsquo;t realise that there&amp;rsquo;s so much more out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like the culture shock of when you visit another country, or when you work for a buisness for the first time and you finally understand what all the fuss is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;rsquo;t realise that they could have so much more energy, because they think they don&amp;rsquo;t realise that it&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the issue is that you have to experience it before you can realise it, and this is the reason most people will never change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot know until you commit, and people are afraid of committing, hence the term &amp;lsquo;average&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are average, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s what you choose to do with it that defines who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-m-not-trying-to-touch-your-children&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Not Trying To Touch Your Children&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/14-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;I&#39;m Not Trying To Touch Your Children&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part is how defensive people get when you mention the paleo diet, as if you&amp;rsquo;re attacking their way of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if there&amp;rsquo;s something inherently immoral, almost disgusting about having a different nutritional opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if I&amp;rsquo;m trying to sabotage the progress of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it’s a numbers game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have more fat, obese, unhealthy, sugar-addled people today than we do people willing to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So rather than target them, we instead find ourselves ridiculing those who are challenging the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that is the problem with society - our current inability to say things for what they are, due to the repurcussions of other people&amp;rsquo;s self-limiting beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, because apparently it’s their ‘choice’ to have a tray of donuts for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet myself on the other hand, am significantly deluded for thinking there&amp;rsquo;s anything positive in having a steak instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet when it comes to those who are actually doing something about their health, they are ridiculed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are ridiculed for trying too hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I will say this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I understand how religious people feel about persecution over their own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s okay too, because this is the world we live in - and your claim is what you can get away with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which in my case, is a healthy body and a self-determination that goes beyond these wods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m doing just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--


Just sayin&#39;, you never see a fat person eat paleo, even if they may be an asshole. 


Most people still believe in the two-party system, some form of god and a whole number of fallacies which would be enough to sedate an entire village. 

However that&#39;s also aside from the point. 


Instead, I think the reason for reigns much deeper than merely &#39;the facts&#39; or our own individual beliefs. 






The funny thing is when people report that it makes them feel like shit.

When they already have been feeling like shit the entire time anyway. 



This is on top of all the inherently bad things in existing non-paleo foods, such as 







You know, you can rip the bandaid off, or you can teeter it slowly until it you eventually whimper at the prickle of your skin hair. 

That&#39;s entirely your choice.


Of course, most of us aren&#39;t, due to the range of modern foods we 



The problem is that most modern foods and diets make it incredibly difficult to do so. 

Most Western diets are 


I eat paleo and here&#39;s why I&#39;m not crazy.

Today I Am Unhealthily Preoccupied With Success
My Unhealthy Obsession With Success
My Delicate Obsession With Success
My Delicate Obsession With Success
My Invalid Obsession With Success
My Unscientific Obsession With Success

My Unreasonable Obsession With Success
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly suspect that my drive for success has a strong connection with my mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me also feels as if I don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference being that when I&amp;rsquo;m not pursuing success of some kind, my brain instead switches and dedicates itself towards pursuing failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which arguably is much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, there is no healthy middleground in my mind. Interally I am always fighting for something, so it may as well be for my improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also the monster that pursuing success turns me into, which solves none of the equally disconjunct aspects of my personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remain just as detached, anti-social and obsessive in my trials to achieve my goals, and like a heavy addiction, it carries me without mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However is that necessarily a bad thing if it is helping me achieve positive outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the obsession is just a bonus to my condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, it&amp;rsquo;s what allows me to remain engaged when the going gets tough, and maintain any sense of hope in the relentless batter that is unrecognised self-study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which could mean that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with me after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet I can&amp;rsquo;t help but ponder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I been so traumatised in my past life as to be like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in a sort of fatal totality here, in which I can&amp;rsquo;t quite gauge my delusion because it&amp;rsquo;s what keeps me productive and above water, so-to-speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those dainty safe-guards keeping me in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;become-the-12-step-program&#34;&gt;Become The 12-Step Program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/13-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Become The 12-Step Program&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure why I&amp;rsquo;m writing this article, however I think part of it is that I want to remove the stigma surrounding success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose there are two stigmas which both hurl itself at each other like a bunch of drunk sailors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental illness and success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, you&amp;rsquo;re viewed as a pompous asshole when you tout your achievements, yet you&amp;rsquo;re also equally as broken for admitting you have mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well fuck that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s a product of misunderstanding, so hear me cry as I provide my perspective on the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success isn&amp;rsquo;t something magical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a magic trick you pull out your ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s literally nothing more than a regime you follow, which you stick with and commit to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind becoming obsessive is so that you can develop a love-affair with your routine, so that your goals and ideals are the only thing you percieve in your mind, as the antitode to your insanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way you do this is through your routine (I like to refer to it as my programming), which I suppose is achieved via a number of effective systems to prevent the subject (myself) from breaking down under all the pressure and stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this blog forms one part of this overall programming effort, and it&amp;rsquo;s been great for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sort of serves as a cognitive lubricant that allows me to stay focused and true to who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These words are designed to program myself to succeed, not only in what I write, however also the in the commitment to ensuring that these words are being delivered every 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a program that benefits my mental health, no difference to attending a number of private therapy sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just like it my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the program is simple: It is designed to teach perseverance and structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the truth is, I&amp;rsquo;m not well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s all that matters, because even though part of me feels shrouded by guilt and shame and depression and all these awful things, I&amp;rsquo;m still above water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than allow these negative aspects of my life drown me, I work towards managing them in a healthy way, and I think my pursuit for success is enabling, rather than all-out disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hard part is convincing myself when the programming fails, which is what usually leads to relapse, where I actually do revert back to my broken, unadjusted self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I assure you, helps absolutely no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-effects-of-a-shitty-childhood&#34;&gt;The Effects Of A Shitty Childhood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/13-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Effects Of A Shitty Childhood&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t choose my shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society did for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want you to picture a young, ambitious Julius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s got a pretty fantastic face and he&amp;rsquo;s being told he can achieve anything in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell, that&amp;rsquo;s the message I&amp;rsquo;m sure all us kids recieved - largely due to the inability of our parents to prove it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Young Julius, you&amp;rsquo;re incredibly smart. You have so much potential to achieve anything you want. Except me, I still earn peanuts which is why we&amp;rsquo;re having cardboard for dinner tonight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that young Julius actually cared about achieving anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All he could think about was the dopamine-sucking video games he wanted to play, because unfortunately our young Julius is living in a paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that young Julius was not taught the value of hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being told he was special, entrenched the idea that he was naturally better than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which worked because I was better than everyone else&amp;hellip; until it didn&amp;rsquo;t, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I really began to struggle in high-school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I completed a major assignment until 4th grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, my mother thought it would be a brilliant to take control of the damn thing, and complete the project herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason being that it would be inherently better, allowing me to have better marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of course, left me in the dust. I mean, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a complete idiot, however I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t reaching my full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, let&amp;rsquo;s also imagine being told that you&amp;rsquo;re not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine being told by your own mother that you&amp;rsquo;re not good enough, everyday for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things worse, she thinks it&amp;rsquo;s okay because she&amp;rsquo;s not saying that exact words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s in the  tone of her voice. In her constant dismissal and backhanded compliments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of it is never telling you what a wonderful job you&amp;rsquo;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s about constantly telling you that you could have done better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I imagine is designed to push you to try harder, however the net effect is that you feel as if you&amp;rsquo;re not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it turns you into a cynic which slowly eats away at you, to the point where you no longer feel comfortable communicating yourself in fear of being judged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s why I never had a close relationship with my mother. Because I wanted to keep myself distant from her words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst of all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the constant judgement you learn to judge yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You learn to hate yourself, because you genuinely feel as if you&amp;rsquo;re not good enough, and it grows inside you like a cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when you pair this pessimism with feeling like you&amp;rsquo;re special&amp;hellip; you create people like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, you can literally say goodbye to your life right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you won&amp;rsquo;t have any normal friends, or be able to sustain healthy relationships, or have a loving family life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless of course you choose to fight for it, which is why I&amp;rsquo;m here, writing this blog today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lovely girlfriend, I know exactly what I want with my life, and I take care not to allow my inner-pessimism to take control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-millenial-factor&#34;&gt;The Millenial Factor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/13-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Millenial Factor&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glaring problem with young Julius is that he&amp;rsquo;s been setup for failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s driven towards success and achievement through his own false idealisation of himself, yet he&amp;rsquo;s also incapable of delivering the goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why he has issues, or at least used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason why I still have issues is that I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to fight this idea in my mind that I&amp;rsquo;m not good enough or that I&amp;rsquo;m not capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which isn&amp;rsquo;t so bad because after all these years, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to understand the value of hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s taken me 95% of the way towards solving my mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the problem is that although people can adjust, ultimately we don&amp;rsquo;t change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still get depressed and triggered for the very same reasons that I did ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only difference is that now at 24 years old, I now know how to medicate myself effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially the self-medication began with replicating success through dopamine, and my gosh, the ways you can do that is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pornography was made me feel incredibly successful, if only temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gambling made me feel successful for a while, but the drawbacks nearly ruined me, which is why I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marijuana helped me forget everything, which is always a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the best medication I&amp;rsquo;ve found thus far has been to pursue my goals and ambitions in a controlled, and sensible manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, to pursue hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The side-effects aren&amp;rsquo;t nearly as having a cigarette at 3am in the morning, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I suppose brings me to my original point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw on top the inherent difficult of life, not to mention the severe disadvantage of millenial life, and I&amp;rsquo;ll need as much drive and help as I can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are literally no available entry-level jobs for our skills set. None of us can afford to buy a home, let alone have children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s only going to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what choice do I honestly have other than to be obsessed with my work, in order to have better opportunities in life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We honestly don&amp;rsquo;t, other than to accept that there is no hope and that is something I cannot accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I will continue to grind until I&amp;rsquo;m able to afford the things I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I also enjoy it and is part of the reason I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to go on for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I worry about is when I actually have the freedom to stop being obsessed, once I have my career and family sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
### We Are A Product Of Society

![We Are A Product Of Society](/img/blog/13-04.png)

So these are the things that happen when I do not commit to the program. 

And yet the program is clearly not perfect. 

It has occassional glitches that cause my perception of myself to revert and break down.

Where I look at myself and don&#39;t feel convinced. 

That you&#39;re nothing more than a phoney, and that it&#39;s all one big lie you tell yourself to...

and this is where I forget. 

I become so enthralled into the programming that I forget why I&#39;m here, who I am, and so I destroy it all in the hopes of starting again. 

It is learning through regret, because my mind has forgotten the importance of program. 

The good news is that I&#39;m learning to program myself in more effective ways, in the hope that I stay fully within my bubble of dream and aspiration.

For example, I have this thing where I think about my future children. 

And that in large part drives me to study and try harder and not try and screw myself over.

The plan is that by being an expert at X and Y I&#39;ll essentially be able to work from home and avoid the expensive costs of childcare etc.

So that that they can have an amazing life and not make the same mistakes that I have.

I want three lovely, outstanding children. 

In part to create a loving family, because it&#39;s something I lacked growing up. 

As if it&#39;s going to create peace in my life. To have people to talk to and take care of. 

I mean, am I stupid for wanting this? Is it superficial? 

Perhaps, but programming is inherently superficial and is all I really have to carry me forward. --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-are-a-product-of-society&#34;&gt;We Are A Product Of Society&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/13-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;We Are A Product Of Society&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often wonder how things would be I were just be normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if I&amp;rsquo;d want to, because there&amp;rsquo;s a kind of balance or harmony in life at the moment that&amp;rsquo;s serene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are working out for this guy, and I know it&amp;rsquo;s because of who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s because of my obsession with success that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to pursue all the opportunities in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt I would have gotten through all those awful jobs if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for my aspiring to become something more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also corrupted me to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m at a point in my life where other people no longer interest me, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s normal or if it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve become so engrained&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like I just don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; see value in them, when I could be studying or working instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just an addict in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 

Yes, I&#39;m still broken. 

But if I can fix myself nearly as fast, it&#39;s almost like I can convince you that I&#39;m normal, while also having my slice of the cake. 



I think I&#39;m at the point where 

 I&#39;m literally always working or studying or reading and I wonder if I&#39;m going insane. 

As time drifts by, I can&#39;t help but feel more and more detached from reality.

The two very impossible steps towards self-awareness

The Two-Step Tango With Self-Awareness
Self-Awareness Is A Two-Step Tango
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like this two-headed medusa that knows all your password combinations, and spits fire at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sort of like an ex-girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly that&amp;rsquo;s a poor comparison, but as you can tell it&amp;rsquo;s something that continues to frustrate me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness is hard because it takes a lot of patience and experience to make work, and even then it&amp;rsquo;s not guaranteed to protect you from your own weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
(though perhaps the point is not to try and fix our weaknesses, but to avoid them instead?)
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes it frustrating is that inspite of the fact that we have full control over our ability to be self-aware, it&amp;rsquo;s not something we necessarily can control well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, because I&amp;rsquo;ve used it to successfully eliminate my urges at their worse, only to relapse a few hours later once I&amp;rsquo;ve let my guard down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All it takes is one offset of self-awareness, in a moment of sadness or frustration, for the wheels to fall dramatically off a wagon that looked so damn-good in that condition report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;ve been the best bumpkin for the past two years, or flying high in dominance without defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And next thing you know you&amp;rsquo;ve downed a six pack of bourbon and the cat is dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, this article isn&amp;rsquo;t designed to make self-awareness &amp;lsquo;easy&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness isn&amp;rsquo;t easy, in the same sense that deadlifting 300lb will never be &amp;lsquo;easy&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, what this article is designed to do is provide you with a pathway forward, so that you can eventually approach that 300lb mark (your mental illness, perhaps?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without having to think too much about your now severely compromised spine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because no one wants a severely compromised spine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless if you&amp;rsquo;re really into severly compromised spine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then totally go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plz don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;self-awareness-is-a-muscle&#34;&gt;Self-Awareness Is A Muscle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/13-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Self-Awareness Is A Muscle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it can help to think of self-awareness as a muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thing you train that requires maintenance and attention, and that grows and improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which without practice and engagement, will die and wither - much like your fruitless ambitions of becoming a YouTube star *points at self*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though what we may not realise is that our muscles are actually quite complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muscles require nutrition, exercise, relaxation - all things we just seemingly do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just that for most us, it&amp;rsquo;s not something we need to think or worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, they just largely do their thing and we can carry on with our day without need for awareness over our muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarily, self-awareness requires context, understanding, empathy - all things we apparently don&amp;rsquo;t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, chances are you&amp;rsquo;re mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means you don&amp;rsquo;t have normal, functioning muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you have spastic, stubborn, piece-of-shit muscles that (at least initially) will very rarely do what you want them too, let alone function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No different to someone learning to walk again - your mind is truly fucked to the point that you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to relearn how to be normal again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s so fucked to the point that your first few years of learning to become self-aware will be filled with months of forgetting that you were even bothering to become self-aware in the first place, because you weren&amp;rsquo;t aware enough to notice that you weren&amp;rsquo;t aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then hoping that your mental health improves in lieu of these circumstances, and assuming you even have the time to dedicate towards your mental health, you may resume working on your self-awareness for another week at a time, before forgetting for another few months into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reality of self-awareness and why most people don&amp;rsquo;t get far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is your ability to influence this &amp;ldquo;muscle&amp;rdquo; limited, however it also offers no predictability what-so-ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, there&amp;rsquo;s no official, nor predictable method for becoming self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While meditation is a recommended means of enlightenment, it&amp;rsquo;s too difficult and subject for most people to grasp, as it&amp;rsquo;s a skill that takes years to become only slighly okay at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It honestly took me years before I even understood the purpose of it, and while my ability to focus has improved significantly - it&amp;rsquo;s still not without flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perspective on the other hand is cheap and like playing with fire, can dramatically backfire because we&amp;rsquo;re also dealing with mindsets here - not merely thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tried it all and it&amp;rsquo;s a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back from the esoteric bullshit and try to make sense of what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to achieve here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s not easy, however that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we must continue running around in circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;defining-the-purpose-of-self-awareness&#34;&gt;Defining The Purpose Of Self-Awareness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/12-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Defining The Purpose Of Self-Awareness?&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness is hard because it&amp;rsquo;s ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;or rather, because people don&amp;rsquo;t know how it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, it&amp;rsquo;s one of those subjects where I could spend the next few hours throwing words at you and still not get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I think it will be benefitial to focus on the aim (or purpose) of self-awareness, so we can better understand what we&amp;rsquo;re ultimately trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-awareness is a tool that is designed to keep you focused&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s literally what self-awareness is, in lieu of how we try to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now admittedly we skipped a few steps here - however they&amp;rsquo;re meaninglessness until we understand the ultimate aim of self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness aims to keep you focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be focused?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you break it down in the context of success, focus can be split into two relevant categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing our effort and attention towards our goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not focusing our effort towards being distracted from our goals i.e. mental illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s honestly it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think where a lot of people stray is in believing that self-awareness is something much more complex or &amp;lsquo;spiritual&amp;rsquo; than it really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which makes sense when you think about it, because when people have that moment of self-awareness where they realise how truly mentally ill and dysfunctional they&amp;rsquo;ve become, it can be an incredibly profound experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I have a more suitable interpretation that is more inline with what self-awareness aims to achieve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-awareness is nothing more than a tool that allows us to create meaning, via control of our output.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness allows us to get more shit done, which allows us to create more meaning in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If self-awareness can allow us to work twice as hard and create twice as many awesome things, then obviously you&amp;rsquo;re gonna think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty fuckin&amp;rsquo; great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful thing about this sentiment is that it also proves that self-awareness isn&amp;rsquo;t something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And instead, is merely a tool that allows you to achieve special things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important to understand, because self-awareness is not a perfect tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people who view self-awareness as this amazing, everything-solving solution can find themselves abusing it and not using it as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that it can protect them from all their problems, and completely ignoring the purpose of self-awareness in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just a tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like how you don&amp;rsquo;t use a hammer to pass a car driving test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness doesn&amp;rsquo;t usually help us in situations where we have to deal with confrontational abuse etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea of creating meaning in our life also extends to our mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us create meaning from our mental illness, which is significant for another reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness also proves that we have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By becoming self-aware we can choose how we create meaning in life, rather than leave it to the unpredictability of our mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the key point here is that hard work (whether spent wallowing over our past, or building a career) allows us to create meaning, and our menaing depends entirely on what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of success, this means being productive and working harder on our goals and ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you&amp;rsquo;ve read my previous article on success (article below), you&amp;rsquo;ll know that hard work does not refer to working your ass off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cross-post-template&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a class=&#34;cross-post-template-title&#34; href=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/2017/03/31/success-is-nothing-more-than-a-verifiable-system/&#34;&gt;Success Is Nothing More Than A Verifiable System&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It refers to the value and opportunity you can create in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for example, meditating six hours a day is a hard work - because it can create a lot of value via the insight it creates etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not because most people find it incredibly boring and mundane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And self-awareness is what allows you to focus on producing hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-two-steps-towards-self-awaresness&#34;&gt;The Two Steps Towards Self-Awaresness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/12-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Two Steps Towards Self-Awaresness&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately there are two processes towards becoming self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One process is okayish, and other process is nearly impossible-to-control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And without these processes aligned, you basically have no chance of becoming self-aware when you need it most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now please pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ll ultimately be describing is about ideally getting yourself into a position of being self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is different from how to actually train to become self-aware, which I will cover later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it is also different to the topic of how you can use self-awareness to achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modularity people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes life easier, not harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is calming/relaxing yourself down to a point where you can be actually be self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the moderately easy part that given enough time, that most people can learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not easy because it&amp;rsquo;s something that just happens (it&amp;rsquo;ll honestly take years) however easy because it&amp;rsquo;s something we can (largely) learn to maintain control over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to compare it to a switch in our brain we can just turn off at will, and float away into a zone of focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s a skill that takes time - and is what I&amp;rsquo;ll be providing instructions on in order to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that it&amp;rsquo;s a skill for life and a skill that gets easier with time, assuming you train it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No different to someone who&amp;rsquo;s learning to walk again, once you streamline this mode of focus in your mind, it will no longer be something you have to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You merely identify the trigger/empowering attribute and you don&amp;rsquo;t ruin yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the overall scheme of things, self-awareness is quite passive because once you get good at it, you can actually use your hard work as a form of meditation and that&amp;rsquo;s where you can become brutal with your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here is where it gets tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step is knowing what to be self-aware of - and is perhaps the hardest part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ultimately, this is only something that can come with time and experience - the two things we don&amp;rsquo;t have any real control over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, you can read a book to help with the &amp;lsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; part, but ultimately your brain is subconscious and is going to do it&amp;rsquo;s own thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be calm, relaxed and focused - however if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be self-aware of, it&amp;rsquo;s like having a semi-automatic machine gun without a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes yourmore spastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the second step is gaining insight into what you need to be self-aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that &amp;lsquo;ah-ha&amp;rsquo; moment of &amp;lsquo;oh wow, I knew my guilt was pointless, but now I can rationalise it in my head!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like when we discover a whole new way of doing something, or a new bit of knowledge that completely blows your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the deal - the remaining calm part is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it becomes dramatically more difficult once you&amp;rsquo;ve been triggered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the two processes come into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remaining calm, you must utilise your insight to remind yourself why it&amp;rsquo;s all bullshit, and return back to pre-triggered state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like defusing a bomb and when you successfully do it, you feel a million dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becoming triggered is a pathway that needs to be prevented well-before the event takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insert future article that explains this concept, cause this article ain&amp;rsquo;t bout that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- artile on pathways and how everything is a pathway --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-become-self-aware&#34;&gt;How To Become Self-Aware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/12-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;How To Become Self-Aware&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest recommendation is to keep it as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because your brain thrives on abusing complexity, especially when it comes to something as ambiguous as self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think simple. Do simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because focus itself is a very simple state, which requires that you dissolve all your thoughts to one single thing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I imagine would be the amazingly wonderful thing you&amp;rsquo;re currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the basic idea behind self-awareness is that it&amp;rsquo;s designed to nudge us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nudge us when we&amp;rsquo;re doing something good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nudge us when we&amp;rsquo;re doing something bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nudge us when we&amp;rsquo;re doing nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like your own personal assistant, only we&amp;rsquo;re the one&amp;rsquo;s in control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to learn self-awareness is to nudge ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which as the word nudge implies, doing things that slightly annoy us or keep us in check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to eventually be able to observe and notice our own feelings and emotions - however that can only come with experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that works super well for most people is placing a ball on the back of their chair at work or at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This serves two purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has a goal in mind, which is to promote correct sitting posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It keeps you self-aware of this goal, as you can constantly feel the ball against your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, if you just do that permanently - you&amp;rsquo;ll learn so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, at some point you&amp;rsquo;ll feel that it&amp;rsquo;s too annoying/uncomfortable and want to remove the ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now two things will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will remove the ball and completely forget about it and your self-awareness journey ends here (what will likely happen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself why you want to remove the ball. Understand that it&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re distracted from your goal (good posture).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very simple thing you can do is just take notice things that you don&amp;rsquo;t usually notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Act differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re walking to the station from work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn around and walk the other way for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then walk back to th station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds stupid? No, it&amp;rsquo;s not, because defying habits is an act of self-awareness and empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to engage your brain so that it&amp;rsquo;s aware of what it&amp;rsquo;s doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point is to observe. Act and observe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step in this process is to realise that you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to observe and that you can simply focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we all discover our own truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main takeaway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice. It sucks. You probably won&amp;rsquo;t do it. But that&amp;rsquo;s the only solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally speaking (aside from doing the ball on the chair thing) I also take cold showers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a safe way to observe your own fear and percieved pain, as well as how you deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cause trust me, that initial confrontation with freezing cold water never gets easier - but how you deal with it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;proving-you-re-actually-self-aware&#34;&gt;Proving You&amp;rsquo;re Actually Self-Aware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/12-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Proving You&#39;re Actually Self-Aware&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that you know what self-awareness is (*cough* a rediculous regime to change the way you think and percieve reality) there&amp;rsquo;s one pressing issue we haven&amp;rsquo;t quite addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we prove that we&amp;rsquo;re self-aware?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly fineline between what is self-awareness and what is delusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason being that we all believe we&amp;rsquo;re self-aware, simply because we believe our own conscious perspective is inevitably the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a difficult question, I think there&amp;rsquo;s one trait that ultimately defines self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being in-control of everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds like a massive requirement, however that&amp;rsquo;s what self-awareness ultimately offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to actively work on your goals everyday without distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to switch between completely unrelated goals without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to detach from your goals without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these factors have one thing in common. They all relate to control and living in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when you&amp;rsquo;re ambitious, though not self-aware, you&amp;rsquo;re driven by an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means this agenda affects the way you feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like you&amp;rsquo;re pursing this agend you feel as if you&amp;rsquo;re missing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s easy to say that delusion has all these things in common with self-awareness, in practice the difference is quite significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not being driven by an agenda, I don&amp;rsquo;t burn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can walk away from my goals without having a complete breakdown, which allows me to relax and regain focus on other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly difficult to get anything willfully being in control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you have people who get lucky on nothing but passion and ambition alone, but for the vast majority of us - control is what allows us to express ourselves to the best of our ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness brings you choice, and it&amp;rsquo;s the most beautiful choice anyone can have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 



We can be going so well with our mental health, only to have everything collapse in a moment of brass irrationality, when a trigger appears like a shiny pokemon in the wild. 



Now, this may not seem optimistic, but that&#39;s hardly the point. 

Self-awareness is about bringing us closer to a more concise understanding of the world, so that we can spend less time battling our own thoughts and assumptions. 




Now when you put these ideals in the context of meditation, self-awareness allows us to meditate longer, and better - hence why it&#39;s seen as this pretty great thing. 

If that&#39;s what you want to achieve.

For the rest of us, meditative enlightenment isn&#39;t likely what we want in life.

Instead, we want careers, money, an attractive and loving partner (or two) - and self-awareness can help you get there.

### How We Prevent Focus 

![How We Prevent Focus](/img/blog/12-02.png)

As we&#39;ve established, self-awareness is largely about maintaining control over our focus. 

To break it down for you, this means spending more time and attention on our goals, and less time and attention on the things that aren&#39;t our goals. 

Sounds simple? 

Of course it is you doofus, but the problem is that none of us actually do it. 

The reasons are numerous, however creating systems, structures and routines is a good place to start. 

For more information, please read the article below:

&lt;div class=&#34;cross-post-template&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a class=&#34;cross-post-template-title&#34; href=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/2016/11/27/why-obtaining-a-full-time-job-should-be-your-number-one-priority/&#34;&gt;Why Obtaining A Full-Time Job Should Be Your Number One Priority&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The idea behind self-awareness is that it&#39;s supposed to nudge us when we aren&#39;t spending time and attention on our goals.

So we can have that &#34;ah-ha&#34; moment in our heads, in order to make a more productive decision within the moment. 

In addition, it&#39;s also supposed to keep us engaged and focused on the things we are trying to achieve. 

Which is a huge aspect many of us forget. 

The reason why it&#39;s hard is because our mind has been trained to play tricks on us, that prevents us from remaining focused.

You know, like that time we subtly developed a mental illness or got massively addicted to some drug from the 90s&#39;. 

Remember earlier how I said that our self-awareness is like a &#34;spastic, stubborn, piece-of-shit of a muscle that at least initially, will very rarely do what you want it too, let alone function.&#34;

Well, that&#39;s the current state it&#39;s in.

&#34;Like a shitty liver, you&#39;re barely getting by as you want another episode of JAG in a state of complete degradation.&#34;

Through mental illness and a number of other life-determining factors, our self-awareness muscle got fucked up. 

So naturally it&#39;s all retarded and stringy, and that&#39;s something we&#39;re personally going to have to rectify.

Not that it&#39;s entirely your fault. 

Cause here&#39;s the thing.

Humans are stupid. 

We get bored. We stop giving a shit. We lie and decieve each other, because some of us are addicts and could care less. 

We come up with all sorts of excuses in our head, about how watching another YouTube clip is vital, even though it&#39;s not. 

...and that&#39;s assuming you don&#39;t have mental illness. 

Then it gets even harder, as we believe we absolutely must be mentally ill, because it&#39;s the right thing to do and it&#39;s just a must. 

Sounds stupid?

Of course it is.

Desiring mental illness is absolutely stupid in the context of success - however that&#39;s because we&#39;re not aware of it. 

When we let our urges get the better of us, we don&#39;t think about how awful or stupid that is for us.

In fact, we don&#39;t think at all. 

**Not because we cannot think, but because we never trained ourselves to think in these situations.**

Self-awareness is designed to switch your brain on again in these moments, and prevent yourself from repeating these patterns.

Part of the probelm is that people think ideologically, rather than rationally - and that&#39;s what self-awareness tries to stop you from doing.

To prevent you from thinking ideologically. 

When you think ideologically you say in your head &#34;I must do this thing, because I fully believe it and feel it inside me&#34;.

It is ideological because you have attached yourself to this version of reality, which although feels convincing down to your bones, is also not in your best interest. 

The way we prevent this is by thinking freely - without ideology or attachment to anything. 

Where you don&#39;t have urges or desires - where instead you have choice. 

The choice to act, rather than be driven by something we do not control.  

Self-awareness is powerful because it provides you with a choice. 

And you know it&#39;s a choice because you&#39;re fighting the stupidity in brain that is asking you to do otherwise. 

And from that perspective, it&#39;s incredibly empowering.

There&#39;s your meat pie, bitch. 



Let&#39;s take meditation for example.

The reason meditation is hard is because we don&#39;t know how to meditate.

We have this idea in our head of what it should be, yet when we sit down and actually do it we can struggle.

We can&#39;t quite keep our focus. Despite trying to focus, our mind keeps wandering off. 

Yet the interesting thing is that all it takes is a bit of insight, and we can find ourselves doing it correctly.   

One example in my case was 

- 



In this state you are focused, 

The second step is to figure out exactly what it is you need to be self-aware of and why it&#39;s important. 

It&#39;s very rare that you&#39;ll ever get the two. 

So that&#39;s what this article is about - increasing your chances towards becoming less retarded. Good luck, schmuck. 



It&#39;s sort of like a background worker that steers your brain from ruining things or having bad thoughts. 


Remember - this is different from actually using that self-awareness to get stuff done.

Because in truth, self-awareness isn&#39;t actually the bulk of the hard work. 




In other words, if you&#39;re

The other aspect is control. If you&#39;re able to freely move between your goals without resistance, then 

For me that&#39;s writing and coding.

Truth be told, I don&#39;t really want to write. 

I mean, I love writing, however I&#39;d much rather be coding and by gosh - once I start coding I don&#39;t stop. 

However since I see the value in writing, it&#39;s something that I&#39;m able to dedicate my time towards 

This also proves that you&#39;re not deluded

I&#39;m in control and when you think about it - that&#39;s really what focus is.



I choose what I want to do.

I think ultimately, what makes me self-aware is that 

It&#39;s being able to control what you want to do.

Because here&#39;s the thing:


I&#39;d like to say that I think I&#39;m self-aware. 


Put simply (and perhaps controversially) if you&#39;re not able to focus, it means you&#39;re not self-aware. 

Because self-awareness isn&#39;t just knowing that you need to be focused. 

Self-awareness is a practice. It&#39;s being able to control your thoughts

Verifiable Systems Work. Please Get Yourself A Verifiable System

--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re a struggle sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undefined blob of human misery, awaiting death in a slurry of shame and complete unanticipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you you feel unable to help yourself become successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either due to lack of knowledge or motivation to even wake up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are living the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your host, the shitty human experience coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myself, Julius Reade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because you fear the potential outcome of your success, producing anxiety via your own self-perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in spite of knowing what you need to do to become successful, you find ways to self-sabotage, ignore and pretend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and of course, as you cozy into your computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It suddenly occurs to you that these are just words, taunting you like a pair of dead mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very things you fight with in your mind each and every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you consider not waking up at 5:50am each morning, to thrive and kick ass, because the bed just loves you more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m here to provide you with a way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To let you know that things don&amp;rsquo;t have to continue the way they are, and that the process must neither be hard, nor difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell you that it really is all in your head, and that while this fact doesn&amp;rsquo;t lessen your shitty human experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is also the reason why most people don&amp;rsquo;t get far with their mental health, their debilitating situations in life, as well as their success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this will be a fun and informative one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;addressing-the-basics&#34;&gt;Addressing the Basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/11-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;A Model For Success&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major reasons why we struggle with success is that we fail to address the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the only reason we struggle with success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t have balance in our ambitions. We don&amp;rsquo;t truly understand what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we may not even be able to envision the outcome of what we want to be amazing at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell, our physical health could be a mess too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not eating healthily, nor getting enough exercise, you are ignoring the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- link to paleo diet article --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this kind of perception of what is fundamental or not to our success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is where I believe most people go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people assume the basics consist of working hard and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very people who in their moment of million-dollar inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget that burnout and depression are very real forces which can take you down within an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who lose track of their mental and physical health, only to wind up a squirel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because guess what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success isn&amp;rsquo;t just a goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some palatable bullshit you achieve and place on a platter for the world to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success is an eco-system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a lifestyle, something you maintain and improve. It&amp;rsquo;s living and breathing, no different to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they fail to understand is that hard work is born out of this eco-system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that when ignored, fails to keep us entertained and motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you abuse this eco-system, when you abuse the basics, you abuse your potential for success, and you will fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the story for those who struggle with success is typical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They spend all their time and energy toiling away, in the belief that their undetermined effort will always prevail over strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They continue doing the same meaningless tasks, over and over again, even if they consciously know  it will have zero impact on their desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who believe they&amp;rsquo;re immune to all the challenges of success, such as self-promotion and maintaining focus and motivation over their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of people who burn out after three months, become depressed and give up due to &amp;ldquo;change of mind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been there. Done that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of online blogs, YouTube channels, podcasts, you name it - where I&amp;rsquo;ve just run in and crashed and burned is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&amp;rsquo;m also here to tell you that it&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That you haven&amp;rsquo;t wasted your time&amp;hellip; essentially, wasting your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because often our efforts towards success are for a greater cause than the outcome itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether for self-discovery or exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, those were certainly important times in your life, however now is also important for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s different because you want nothing more than to crush the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And leave your mark on the world in the form of fat bank cheque and a conclave of irreversible environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like running into a small African village with nothing more than a machette and a machine gun, taking out an entire generation of defenseless nomads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we just want to dominate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m here to tell you that there is a way forward, where you can have your cake and eat it too if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I&amp;rsquo;m here to tell you that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be cynical and without hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the basics are simple, which means the solutions are simple as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thankfully, this means we&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on constructing a framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A framework for success which will be consistent, easily producible and can be widely applied to anything in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because put simply, frameworks simply work - CAUSE THAT&amp;rsquo;S WHAT A FUCKING FRAMEWORK DOES, YO&amp;rsquo;LL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the most important question we have to ask in regards to this framework is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;success-is-a-veriable-system&#34;&gt;Success Is A Veriable System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/11-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;A Model For Success&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folks, if you&amp;rsquo;ve just returned from the break, unfortunately ol&amp;rsquo; Johnny ist dead and I think you look wonderful today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So upon the age old question of interpretation, what on earth is success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I said it a lil&amp;rsquo; earlier, but let&amp;rsquo;s dig that tiny bit deeper into your subconscious for another time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success is a verifiable system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing more. Nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exactly is a verifiable system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that would be the framework, you dummy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this ultimately means is that if we do and understand what&amp;rsquo;s required for our success, and if we follow our framework, we can place ourselves in a position to obtain our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success is a system of structured processes, that enable us to work effectively towards our goals and ambitions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still don&amp;rsquo;t get it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, let&amp;rsquo;s break it down some more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success is a process, which facilitates hard work, which facilitates bringing you closer towards your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You follow the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process enables you to work harder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hard work produces verifiable results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the key point here is work, because what&amp;rsquo;s important to note is that these structured processes don&amp;rsquo;t actually provide you with buckets of success, straight to your door, with no additional charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead what it does provide you with is the ability to work harder and better than everyone else, which is ultimately how success is born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the humbling constructs of time and hard work - the same constants we&amp;rsquo;re all living through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though here is where it gets more crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other key point is hard (as in hard work), and it&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly important point that needs to be addressed ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No seriously, FUCKING ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard work does not mean work that is laborious or demanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can do this so-called &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; work, which is why it&amp;rsquo;s not hard. It is merely dull and unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes hard work &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; is the value and opportunity it creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, anything that is equal opportunity cannot be considered hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demonstrable struggle that people exhibit with their success, indicates that most people have been failing to do what&amp;rsquo;s truly hard to obtain their success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have been struggling with your success because you have been avoiding hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though please let me spell it out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard is working on your branding and marketing, and getting people to pay attention to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard is working on the weaknesses which you blatantly refuse to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard is setting the healthy and enabling expectations in your mind, so you&amp;rsquo;re in-control of your emotions when the going gets tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard isn&amp;rsquo;t spending eight hours a day producing content in the hope that SEO will bring you results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s easy because ANYONE can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means a large portion of people do it, and choose to fight an up-hill battle which is incredibly time-consuming to master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell, there&amp;rsquo;s content mills that charge people $3 per article to do this stuff, so it&amp;rsquo;s foolish to think that content will ever hold on it&amp;rsquo;s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, When you don&amp;rsquo;t pursue hard work, you don&amp;rsquo;t follow the basics and you sabotage your success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working hard is a basic. In fact, anything that meaningfully contributes towards your success can be considered basic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate even further upon this idea of the verifiable system, there are two core themes for us to focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistency - The framework must prevent you from crashing or burning out, and assist you in functioning 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness - The framework must be productive, and assist you in working harder, to help you get closer towards your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two aspects are ultimately what make systems verifiable, and is what we are going to focus on today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your framework cannot assist you in getting closer towards your goals, in addition to help you function 100% of the time, then it is not verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if a system cannot be verified, quite simply, it cannot not work to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, unverifiable systems are the kinds of systems most of us dabble in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And is part of the reason why we end up burning out, losing interest and getting nowhere with our ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the reason we waste our time pursing meaningless tasks, because we don&amp;rsquo;t bother to question the faulty assumptions leading us nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s not because you suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s because the system or line of reasoning we&amp;rsquo;ve been following sucks, and enbracing that has made us suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmmmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-systems-go-astray&#34;&gt;When Systems Go Astray&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/11-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;We Don&#39;t Want The System To Work&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems, shitty systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose there are a spectrum of systems, from the highly enabling to the downright dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there are a few generalisations we can make in trying to understand what bad systems are, as well as how we can avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin bad systems are usually not self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning that they hide details from us, or intentionally prevent us from focusing on things that are important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases due to ignorance, however in large part by design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either consciously or subconsciously, we design these systems not to be self-aware, because on some level we know they don&amp;rsquo;t work or are afraid of the work that&amp;rsquo;s required, so we keep these details hidden from ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is often the case when we become deluded by our ideas, and how great we think they are/will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s what allows us to avoid pursuing hard, meaningful work - because we&amp;rsquo;re either afraid or do not have the courage to pursue our goals in an effective manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this kind of information hiding isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because at the end of the day, over-thinking and worrying about the small details is counter-productive to our success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only cavet is that reflection and self-introspection is important when we&amp;rsquo;re starting out with building these systems, in order to gauge our progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the beautiful thing is that verifiable systems work - so once you do find a working configuration, you can ultimately remain as unconscious to your schedule as much as you like - the routine simply carries you through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key point, and one that we very rarely think about it, is that we can end up choosing goals or ambitions that don&amp;rsquo;t require hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, pursuing ideas that don&amp;rsquo;t have value or opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excessive content writing can be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue is that goals that don&amp;rsquo;t require hard work, are also often a lot more difficult to verify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ultimately all we can verify is our success, and when there&amp;rsquo;s little success to be had, it can be a bit jarring and discouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of what makes systems bad is lack of routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that point of consistency we were talkin&amp;rsquo; bout earlier?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routine is what helps embed that consistency and the less routine you have, the more you leave your life to chance, and less to the rational decisions in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s what helps create habits and when you lock down habits, you spend less time thinking and more time working (hard, hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other positive benefit of routine is that it consolidates our process of verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the more we can verify and experience positive results, the better it will make us feel and is part of what keeps us from burning out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Article on routine --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly, routine is your best friend and you should spend all your time with him/her/it, depending on your sexual preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very key point about bad systems is that they generally lack vision or outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what the general outcome of your work will be, then you will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, and this is quite crucial, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you want to be, nor the processes you must take in order to get there, then you will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your vision, at the end of the day, is what holds you together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s what keeps you on track, and more importantly, hopeful of what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this can be a tricky area which can tip over into becoming significantly deluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much so that we ignore the reality of the idea, and merely attach to this belief in our minds as the arbiter of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why it&amp;rsquo;s important, at least initially until you become comfortable with your system, to remain self-aware of what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, this is verifiable system afterall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of verifiable systems is that once you establish them, you can stop verifiying them or at the very least, keep the verification to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;creating-a-verifiable-system&#34;&gt;Creating A Verifiable System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/11-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creating A Verifiable System&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now listen, a lot of this may seem scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, how on earth am I supposed to know where I&amp;rsquo;m going to end up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, you don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, the system knows for you and it&amp;rsquo;s trust in this system that&amp;rsquo;s going to pull you forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t really know what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen or how it&amp;rsquo;s going to turn out, or even what it&amp;rsquo;s going to provide you with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you really have are the experiences and outcomes of others who have gone to university, and that is usually the basis of which we use to verify our reasoning for going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterall, you have no experience with university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because at the end of the day, and I will keep repeating this, however these are the basics we are dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ignore the basics, you will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look back at our definition of success as a verifiable system, there&amp;rsquo;s another aspect for us to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea of structured processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structured processes are the bread and butter of our framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which in layman&amp;rsquo;s terms means hard work and routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, consistency and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process is the thing we do i.e. study for one hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure is how we organise these processes in order to produce a verifiable system i.e. study for one hour each day, depending on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as much as I could describe what these things are, I think it might be helpful is if I just tell you what I personally do, so you can get a better idea of what these ideas mean to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I have a lot of routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work out three times a week, without fail. I have a dedicated fun and study night with the girlfriend. I wake up at 5:50am everyday. I study during the same morning and evening blocks each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time is more-or-less planned, though the specifics of what I do with my time aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily. I usually write my articles in the morning train-ride, and then study programming on the train-ride back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never not have something productive to do. I have lists, I have back-up lists, I have additional weekend hobbies that keep me preoccupied - I don&amp;rsquo;t let myself stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I work hard on things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work on self-promotion on twitter. I write articles. But they aren&amp;rsquo;t the main things at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely, I&amp;rsquo;m working hard on building my Saas application called &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningschedule.com&#34;&gt;Learning Schedule&lt;/a&gt; which essentially aims to be my business, and which hopefully can broaden my sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, I have vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know exactly where I want to be. Because all my actions are verifiable, I can see the impact my learning and working on my application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason why I&amp;rsquo;m creating Learning Schedule is so I can have a portfolio in order to become a coder, and becoming a coder is a strong part of my vision, where I see myself and who I want to become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is only a starting point, and there&amp;rsquo;s so much more I hope to cover in a seperate post, I think a big part of what makes it work is planning. Everything is planned and understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I suppose makes this difficult is that this planning has come as a result of immense trial and error, which is something that requires failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, humans tend to learn through experience, rather than what they&amp;rsquo;ve been told - although listening can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Link to post about routine --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more about routine, I highly recommend reading my article about full-time work and how that&amp;rsquo;s an amazing starting point for developing routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;cross-post-template&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a class=&#34;cross-post-template-title&#34; href=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/2016/11/27/why-obtaining-a-full-time-job-should-be-your-number-one-priority/&#34;&gt;Why Obtaining A Full-Time Job Should Be Your Number One Priority&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, verifiable systems are designed to keep you honest - as they respond relative .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;don-t-only-address-the-symptoms&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Only Address The Symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://juliusreade.com/img/blog/11-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;My Personal Verifiable System&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there&amp;rsquo;s an interesting point to take note here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t specifically address any of the symptoms of struggling with success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because here&amp;rsquo;s the thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a verifiable system in place, these symptoms no longer become an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is to say that verifiable systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t burn out when you have a verifiable system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 

Because it certainly is much worse, you eclectic piece of crap, as you barely cope with the hours of self-agony you currently recognise as living-consciousness. 


You could be reading someone else&#39;s blog and giving them page views and that&#39;s a huge no-no. 

As a certified angel of truth and arbiter of all things righteous:

I&#39;m bloody here to help. 



I&#39;m going to let you in on a secret. 

In fact, it&#39;s not really a secret, because you&#39;re not stupid and you know exactly what you have to do to become successful. 

You just don&#39;t do it. 

And that&#39;s what we have to address. 

The funny thing is that while you know what this secret is, that isn&#39;t to say that you&#39;re aware of what it is. 

So rather than tell you, I&#39;m going to describe this secret in full detail so that by the end of this article, something might click in that mind of yours and you&#39;ll do just as your ambitions intended. 





Humans have a habit of dysfunctioning. 

We lie to ourselves. We deluded ourselves. We needlessly throw away opportunities - we falther. 

because a fact you have not yet accepted, because you&#39;re too distracted to truly want success. 



The system they utilise to train soldiers works.  

What makes systems so brilliant is that they&#39;re verifiable.

The problem most people face is that they fail to utilise or discover a system that works for them. 

Either they lose motivation too quickly, struggle to learn or  

But wait!

Did I say earlier that are systems veriable? 

Well yes, they do - if you continue reading.

The only issue is that the so-called &#39;systems&#39; attempted weren&#39;t verifiable . 

The problem is that instead of treating success as a system, we instead treat it as this unknown foreign object. 

Ultimately, hard because they absolutely vital and necesssary for your success.

And most people are confused and afraid of being successful, which is why they avoid hard work. 





// really good points, perhaps I should add them in. 

Now there&#39;s a secret about verifiable systems which people don&#39;t talk about, and it&#39;s by design. 

And in some ways, it goes against some of the princicples I&#39;ve mentioned earlier.

However highly successful verifiable systems don&#39;t need to be verified. 

Which is to say that successful verifiable systems don&#39;t need to make you think.

Because the more time you spend thinking, the less time you spend working towards your goals. 

In other words, verifiable systems minimise the need for introspection, and at the very least, negative introspection. 

That is, fix things that aren&#39;t working.

Instead, verifiable systems tend to allow you to improve processes, rather than remove or fundamentally change them.
