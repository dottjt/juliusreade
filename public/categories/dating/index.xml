      <description>Firstly, I&amp;rsquo;m quite impartial to pick up.
Despite the fact that pick up is willingly demonised by society, it is also a process that is widely expected of men.
Which traditionally works well&amp;hellip; except for men who are mentally retarded, socially inept or come from broken homes.
You know, like myself.
Happen to lose several limbs in a horrible, though defiantly necessary war?
Forget about it.
Regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s this dynamic that leads to the wide range of sexual activity here on earth, from the consensual to the prolonged jail sentence of your local pedophile.</description>
