It's what causes us to flounder like a stale packet of dagwood dogs, drifting around without an undeserving mouth to consume our misery.

Of course, entirely depending on your flavour of the month - which can range from complete amorphism to feeling absolutely nothing at all. 

The scary thing is that society doesn't really care about your flavour of the month.

It only cares if you can make money from it. 

Which is great if you can make that work for you, however most of us with mental health issues do not have that ability. 

And in a many cases, certainly should not. 

Which means instead, that we have to play our part in society and produce something 'useful' - like puppies or false promises of utopia. 

I mean, as much as I would love to be mentally ill and constantly drug-fucked. 

The reality is that pursuing our disorders stop being fun after a certain level of poverty.

Rather than embracing the escape, you instead find yourself becoming sad and depressed for very legitimate reasons, such as being unemployed. 

Not to mention for many of us, stability is the only way we'll ever seek success in life.

Yes, that awful s-word so many of us fear. 

I suppose the crux of it all is that if you're ever going to understand your mental illness, you'll probably need to figure out how your emotions work. 

Which I'm sure many people find terrifying. 

After all, part of the elusiveness of mental illness is in choosing not to understand yourself, as there's a kind of glamour to the ditzyness of being in shame.

And I would totally agree.

But I'm not here to agree. 

I'm here to connect you with reality. 

Because ultimately behind the veil we profess, our emotions aren't really that complex at all.

We're just idiots.
