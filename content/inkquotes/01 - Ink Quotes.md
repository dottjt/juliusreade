Unfortunately this post won't contain any Tumblr double-speak. No vague attempt will be directed at style, conceptual oversight etc. Your appeal towards teenage heart break will be denied and the rest of the world will continue to function over your bloody corpse. Oh, sorry there? Did I mention the word "function", that two-bit understanding, clouding your thoughts?

Blah, blah, blah, blah.
