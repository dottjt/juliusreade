When you think about it. Like really, really think about it. When you think about it to the point of pain. When nothing is left, but the evaporation of your remains in the horror to the sound that is your name(?). When your brain is on the edge of destruction, destroyed by sea and land. The final elements of your disaster. Who will you stand? Til death, until die. The shame was mine. Forever and after.
