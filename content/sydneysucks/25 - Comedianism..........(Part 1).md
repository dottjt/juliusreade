DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT (cause i cbf fixing it at the moment)

Uh, HELLO and welcome to a little thing I'll be doing over the holidays, exposing the secrets behind my persona as a professional comedian. Firstly, may i say that ALL THIS is entirely based on my own knowledge as a potential comedian. So, when i first thought about this, I didn't realise the amount of 'stuff'' i actually have to cover, so I'll try and do my best job relying solely on my experience as an accredited 'funny man'. Oh by-the-way, I'm not exactly a professional comedian yet, just a 'really good friend'. I'm hoping that perhaps YOU can learn something from this, and that I ALSO can learn from...............fuck it.

May i first make the point that there are two kinds of people in life. People who create ideas, and people who implement ideas. For example, a director creates ideas, and an actor performs it. In order to become a successful and funny comedian you should be fluent in both skills, although you should have a basic grasp in creating ideas, first. But also that there is a noticeable difference between an actor and a comedian, you simply CAN'T be both at the same time. The difference being that actors aren't actually funny, although perceived to be. Then again, anyone and try to be funny. However, I'm not suggesting that a visual joke isn't funny, you'll simply learn more as you develop...............yourself.

Now most people will have different tastes and styles in what they think is funny and meaningful. This can be of two basic things. Either using original ideas (quoting movies etc.), or coming up with something entirely different (usually making a comment on something etc.). This is also an other defining point between an actor and a comedian. Actors will usually quote something and comedians will usually come up with something entirely different or similar. However, I'm certainly not suggesting that you can' quote 'things' as a comedian, it's just that it won't work on a commercial basis, as opposed to a personal basis. It's basically a cheap way to make a joke, that will most certainly not affect you're title/reputation as a comedian. I don't advise doing it when you are really trying to impress someone, although it's often reliable and effective. I'll explain the difference between a commercial basis and personal basis later........

More on you're own personal style, anyone can make a joke it's just how and what the joke is:

HOW; How are you going to tell it? There are many ways to tell a joke, however you have to consider many factors, usually based on you're own personal experiences and audience. In terms of audience, remmeber this one rule: Just because you have a funny joke, doesn't nessesarily mean that you need to tell EVERYONE. Jokes are special for what they are, so don't ruin it by exposing it to wider crowd, just tell a friend etc. However, this does lead to plagurism of you're own joke, so be cautioned!!!!!! Just think about the context of the joke. Is it Shocking? Pleasant? Rude? Sarcastic? Personally, if i make a shocking/striking comment on 'something', I'll usually pretend to be personally shocked, looking as if i also didn't see it coming. However, I might just say it out loud and confidently/quickly to get the impression that "I know what I'm talking about, with that clasification of understanding". Now I'm sure this may not make much sense to you, which is why you really have to experiment with different methods in presenting you're jokes.

WHAT; What is you're style/content of your joke? Remmeber that anyone can make a joke, however it's the joke that makes the person. If it's one of those long jokes with a cheesy punch line in the end, then you won't have much of an expectation, thus not effecting you're reputation as a funny person. Why? Because the 'audience' are expecting it to happen. Remember this one rule: The best jokes are unexpected. No commedian can ever predict when a classic joke will spill out of their mouth, although you're ability to make jokes will increase with experience and even more experience. However, I'm not expecting everyone to be able to be make an unexpected joke, escpeically is you are younger (bellow the age of 13). If you are over the age of 13 and you rarely ever make an unexpected joke, then may i suggest that you will probably never have the potential to become a truely funny comedian. I'll go into more detail later.

Also, may i also say that if you are reading this in order to try and become an actually commedian, you'll never succeed. True comedians can't learn to be funny, no matter what. It's a natural talent that happens as you develop you're mind...................however, you still have a slight chance to become an actor.........................

------------------------------------------------------------

I'm sorry but there is literally too much to talk about, however i need to end this incredibly long post. I've tried to base this post of the vaery basics of comedy, so it's quite incomplete.

Comedianism..........(Part 1) DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT 
Hmmm........it's not all fun and laughter, although a large proportion is. As with most 'things' in life, being a comedian can be difficult, if not a burden on society. Like most 'hobbies/attitudes', practice makes perfect. Much like with playing instruments. You practice to get better, although trying to make people laugh varies and is quite different in some ways. However, I'm not exactly a professional commedian, just a 'very good friend'............

Prepare to make enemies: Most (good) comedians will usually make fun of something or someone in order to create tention, thus laughter. I'm sure if you look at ALL the classic examples, you'll find that most comedians will make fun of others in their 'work'. Problem being, that some topics are considered 'more taboo' than others, which can often result in a 'cult following' or perhaps 'anti-effect' on ones self. However, this is the natural process into becoming a good comedian, as you can't win over everyones' heart........
