I haven't been posting becuase i just don't have the time to, and probably won't be for a long time soon. However, I will begin to post audio grabs from certains shows and etc. (perhaps including myself). Currently, i'll be uploading a radio show called 'The Comedy Hour' on Abc 774 radio, which is a weekly comedy program with............comedy?

Why? Well, reason being that i don't actually think that there'll be a podcast, and so therefore will be 'valueable'? I only talk from personal experience, because there have been many radio shows in the past that i'd wish i'd have a copy of but don't, because the stupid producers won't release a god-damn podcast!!!!!!! (Sort of the same thing with 'Today Today' with Chris Taylor and the other dude.)

PS: I have the bloody Sunday podcasts though.

PSS: Also, the first recording for 'The comedy hour' is missing the first ten minutes, and some of the quality isn't good, because I had never weven heard of the show, until i tuned into the radio at the exact moment the show started, and because it was my first time recording something from the radio, so i had to experiment with volume settings, because i didn't that it was the first show, and was in fact going on air for a very long time........?

PSSS: God damn it, I'm only 15!!!!!!!!! I haven't got the resources or time to try and do stuff like this........
