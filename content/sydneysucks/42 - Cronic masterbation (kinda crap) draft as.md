Meet Polly, a young woman who suffers from cronic masterbation. On the outside she may look like an innocent teenager dressed up in a nice cosplay from Naruto, but little do people know of her true and dark secrets.

"I think it first happened after watching Shrek on the bus home from grade 3 camp. All of a sudden i felt this need to "express myself", which is when i began touching my 'happy spot'. Afterwards I felt ashamed which is why i told my teacher, and now he's been touching my happy spot ever since."

However, Polly isn't the only one suffering of cronic masterbation. Please step forward Samuel Lindsay. 

Samuel has been renound for his performances on stage in such broadway extravaganza's as: "How i met your mother: the musical" and "Disney's Tarzan". Off stage; it's a whole different story.

"It really doesn't help when you also suffer from premature ejaculation, which means i'll masterbate over 500 times a day; just to get my daily fix"

Samuel is currently undergoing therapy down at his local morgue.

"I don't know, but when i see dead people i seem to stop my habits, unless of course i see a young child in a coffin; that's usually when i'll crack my junk out and clean the sack out dry." 

I also hear that you're massively into the gay porn?

"Oh man, don't get me started on the gay porn i seriously can't help myself. When two poles from the same sex re-unite, it's like a party in my pants; only without the drunk chicks ruining everything."

But Sam, I thought you were straight? 

"Well i WAS straight, until i discovered my true innerself. Having sex with a man can be equally as fun as having sex with a woman, escpecially if you have a small dick like mine. Have i mentioned yet that I'm going through a horrible breakup with my mildly hot girlfriend?"

So Sam, what are your plans for th future?

"Well I'm currently trying to find a job that allows me to masterbate while i perform simple tasks like eating and sleeping. I haven't been able to find a job yet, probably because they think I'm overqualified; escpecially my application as a helper down at the local kindergarten."

In other words, if you do suffer from cronic masterbation, it's probably best you stay away from the man described within this article. (Even if he's the guy offering you drugs at a party)
