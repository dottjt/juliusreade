I finally got a new computer today (yay!!!!), which will probably mean I'll be spending less time writing articles, and more time playing games. It's literally the best computer ever, but all I'll tell you, is that it has 4 GB ram :)

In addition, If you're noticing that I'm using the same words and jokes, it's because, one, I don't read (It's so boring), and two, because I'm desperatly running out of 'material'/ideas to write about, after 10 months of writing random crap that doesn't really have a point. So, you may notice that my jokes and/or subject of matter will become even more rude.

Oh, and if you see articles starting at [Part 3] and you're thinking wtf, it's one, because I've started the series of articles in one of my past blogs, and am wishing to continue the series, and two, I haven't reposted the parts because my previous articles are so bad and unfunny. Although i'll probaly be saying the same thing about these articles in ten months time.

PS: 512 MB video card ;)

PSS: I don't think ANYONE is actually reading this.

PSSS: Argggghhhhhh!!!!! I need ideas!!!!!!!!
