I've just thought of the best idea for a video, based on videogames. It's going to be like my past ssb video, just 100 billion times better. I can't give away too much, apart from the fact that It's going to take a hell of a long time (Especially for all the footage i require), however, It'll be really good. Trust me on this one, if you're even reading this.

PS update: This post was due about 1 week ago, and NO it's not the footge thats taking the most time to 'create', it's actually the stupid fking editting. (You'll see why when you see the video. Although i doubt you will ANYWAY.
