Some people would foolishly think that it would be really easy to write an article exploiting the reasons and issues behind 'tea bagging'. But let me tell you, it's not. Thought, dedication, commitment, rejection and other sexist ideas are bound together, before sucking in your entire face, killing all your relatives and such. However, I'm sure that there are many capable people out there with the ability to write articles without struggle. I'm not one of those people.

My ability to read is virtual non-existence; My limited attention span forces me to only socialise with my incredibly hot brother, before turning to my large collection of video games and porn; As with my constant habit to crave for an infinite line of cocaine at my disposal. Now many of my friends call my 'drug habit' an addiction, but i tell them to get stuffed, just as i take another hit of heroin. It's simply not true, just take a look at my usage. Allegedly, I only take a combination of Heroin and Cocaine 3 times each hour, which is absolutely nothing as compared to former personality, Darryl Summers and his habit for bad jokes.

Not only have i taken this post to make a poor, but well-deserved Darryl Summers joke, but also for the new and slightly improved introduction to "Sydneysucks.blogspot.com". I guess it'll be my new domain to bitch about fat people and there tendency to eat, while us 'normals' swim around in left-over scraps, hoping for a decent meal to eat.............

So if you thought that the above statement was offensive, let it serve as a reminder, or let's say 'test' to the future content of this site/blog. If you were:

Heavily Offended: May i suggest that you hide in your closet, hoping that i won't jump at you with a burning cross and cut your throat..................with the burning cross???? WTF,,..?!

Slightly Offended: Quickly, turn off your computer and sell it to a Chinese man with a dodgy accent, before he sells it back to you for twice the retail value.

Slightly Amused: Then welcome!!!!! Please continue reading, as you'll find that things are about to get a whole lot worse............

Heavily Amused: I spend hours on end writing these fking articles and.................wait a sec, oh sorry i thought this was "Heavily Offended". I meant: Read the above comment.

So there you have it boys and girls. You either like me, hate me, or more accurately 'Aren't reading this'. How do i know? Over the period of my last blog i got 12 views from 3 months of dedication, which says a lot about the future of this blog and my success as a writer. But there is an upside. There's simply no one to be offended, hopefully meaning a lesser chance i'll get sued ;)

"Anyone thinking 'WTF??. In other words, this blog was created as a successor of:

- Melbournesucks.blogspot.com
- Adelaidesucks.blogpsot.com

Have a closer look for more details. (Not advised for the 'weak-hearted')"

"I'll admit that this article isn't that good as compared to others, but it's my first article for this blog, so I'm willing to pretend like it's not such a big deal.........."

PS: I don't have an incredibly hot brother, let alone any siblings. Still leaving the question: Am i gay?
