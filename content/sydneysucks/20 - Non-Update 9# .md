I've finished my video, however, because of the absolutely shit quality on you youtube, there's no point watching it there. It's basically a music video that plays with the beat of the song. Great concept, however you really need to see it in a larger screen to get that dose/hit of "Julius". None-the-less:

The River - Good Charlottle - 60823 KB

I highly suggest watching it, that's if you don't have dial up. Unless if you want to spend 5 hours downloading it. It's 58 MB, so yeah.

The reason why i haven't been writing much if anything over the past 2 weeks/1 week, is because I've been spending most my time on my video. Overall, I had about 80+ Gigs of footage, and about 400+ clips. It took at a bitch load of time to make, but meh, it was probably worth it in the long run........

And Sam, i know you're reading this (Most likely the only one), but if you see any mistakes, can you like leave a comment. (Although you're computer skills are so shocking you have to get your get your brother Henry to help scroll down the page for you {Oh snap Bitch!!!}). Sorry bout that Sam, you just had it coming.

I'm going to have to stop the Sam referrences in my articles.............NOW, wait shit, no wait..........NOW!!!
