I don't enjoy hurting other people, but when necessary i make sure i go for the kidneys first, then the face. It's a well known fact that 'punching your best friend in the face' or 'dry humping a pillow' has it's moments, but sometimes you just have to Move on. In my own case, I allegedly used to manufacture drugs and smuggle children into Australia from the Lebanese border with those Chinese containers you find in takeaway stores. As time moved on however, my obsession became an addiction, a state that ruined my life. I hardly got laid, I couldn't stop feeling myself up, not to mention the overall stress from my dad refusing to return my virginity. I understand that many of you can relate to these issues, which is why I'm going to try and 'help' you and your misguided thoughts on Child Porn and the Iraq War, while maintaining a balance in your sex life with your 'incredibly hot' ex-wife. But before that, let me dig deep into your fetus, swimming through the red liquid towards the spleen, solving such issues as: How to move on...........

It wasn't until the age of 15 when i stopped smoking and instead took up cocaine, thus Moving on. 'But isn't that worse' you say? Well, i guess it all depends on how you look at it. I now work as a prostitute so i can pay for the drugs, which means I'm earning more cash*. I'm spending less time on the computer, while injecting more heroin into my blood system, regardless of all the legal complications. My 3 year old daughter has to look after herself, because I'm always getting smashed, which can benefit her development as a child and teach her some unknown, yet valuable skills.

On the other hand, illegal drugs have been known to be Bad. But why explain the bad, when you could be playing outside with your friends or making sand castles in front of a stranger you don't know, and sometimes licks your body like he thinks it's alright and you just let him because you think it's cute............ It's 'okay' i say, which is advise you should value and perhaps tell your kids................if you're not too drunk.

Despite our differences, it can't be too hard to try and 'Move on' to an other activity. Personally, I suggest a quiet session of Chess by the beach, as your 8 year old son sexually humps the evaporating moisture dripping from your arm pits. Verging on the topic of children, they can be a key role to try and 'Move on'. Let's admit it. We both hate children and wish that everyone under the age of 12 would just die. However, they can be useful to do certain work, especially around the house. I mean, do you really want to clean the asbestos from underneath the house?

If No: Thank God, because with some candy and a bucket filled with cleaning product, you too can easily remove this deadly product with the help of your useless piece-of-shit child/children.

Step one, Give birth to a child. (If you're a man, just kidnap your neighbours child or w/e).
Step two, Lock your 'alleged' child underneath the house and tell him 'that if he doesn't clean out all the asbestos from underneath the house, you won't let him out and that he will eventually die anyway'. Taunt him/her with some candy.
Step three, Eat the candy. (Personally, I'll eat it in front of the child, and then tell him that if he finishes before midnight, you'll give him the wrapper).
Step four, Don't let your child out, eventually leading him to die and be infested with disease. After all, funerals can be expensive.
Step five, Convince your wife/husband that your son/daughter was unimportant and that he secretly "Left us" for the greater good.
Step Six, Don't let the police find out. Unless if you like publicity.
Step Seven, Repeat the process until all the asbestos has disappeared, while feeling proud of what you've done.
Step Eight, Stop following the steps you retard.
Step Nine, What the fuck did i tell you!!!!! Stop reading this you dickhead.
Step Ten, For fuck sake, you have ten seconds to stop reading this.
Step Eleven, Count to 10 if you're a complete retard and/or have nothing better to do.
Step Twelve, I give up. You really are stupid.

If Yes: Well, you probably are a child.................so get stuffed.

Now wasn't that easy? In fact, it was so easy that all my friends and neighbours pay me to force my son to clean their asbestos and many other problems, and now I'm rich. Other services include cockroach infestation, HIV/AIDS, Your drug addiction?, and any other mental and possibly life threatening ordeals.
