The very burden or problem about writing articles for this blog is that i can't be too specific about anything, that is if i am to have a Global audience. It's sort of like why they had to make a new season of Kath and Kim in America, mainly because of all the Australian references, that even i feel cheated by. So why even bother? Well, that certainly is a question that people with professional standards fear the most and the reason is MONEY.

Unfortunately due to my proper and very well upbringing, i was in a stage of constantly developing my mind and social skills with very specific detail. I was trying out new things, learning about the future, past and present. I'm overwhelmed by choice and opportunity, and yet it is only the beginning. I somehow avoided alcohol and drugs in my teenage years and live and indulge into the wealth of my family. But that simply isn't enough..................yet.

I really enjoy what i do, which is to comment on life and experience its finer parts at my own pace to a reasonable extent. But there's one thing for sure, and that's the fact that I'm still living in a healthy and eligible condition. Well, with a one exception that doesn't have a permanent effect on my life. I'm not a hippie/emo or rebel, although i do experience the opinions of those who are. I'm apart of a greater social network of the people i like, and not the tolerance of those who try to degrade my way and quality of life. I am who i am. I don't indulge myself into the motion of peer pressure, i simply force the recipient to adjust to my own changes, or shall they leave and possibly degrade they're quality of life.

I hate enemies, although they make my life more interesting and challenging. Enemies are my best friends, although my worst. I'm not a cynic, I'm simply not your type. I seek for people like me and appreciate my talents and opinions as a person. Otherwise, you probably don't know me and wish me nothing but hatred, which i understand. I like to make the most of my time, learning things that people often don't know and use it to my advantage. However, i still have a lot to catch up on since I lacked any decent commonsense until i was 14, although my opinion on that issue is always changing. I'm still trying to uncover my past and rediscover my knowledge and past experiences. 'Choice' is the only thing holding me back from taking my goals and fulfilling them, although my goals aren't fundamental in obtaining true fame and opportunity.

I look at other professionals in life and see their standard to which i truly feel unimpressed. But i also look at it as a deviation to prove myself. To mock the losers in society that called themselves "professionals", although it's only their brand that keeps them alive. I'm more than that. I offer while i deliver. You can never be too young to succeed, although reputation is another important aspect worth discussing.................

Some might say that i haven't fulfilled my teenage years in having a girlfriend, and i resent those people. 90% of the people i know with girlfriends, are truly phony. I have better things to do with my time. I think i might get famous first, then get what i want. Girlfriends aren't important, it's the experience that counts.

So why even bother? This is my future fund. As a child, money came and it disappeared and so now i must think of long term investments. Short term investments are just not viable. Money is evident within my family, although it's just not there. At least not in the form that we'd want it to be in....................
