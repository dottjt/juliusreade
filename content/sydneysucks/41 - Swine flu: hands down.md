My hand SURE IS dangerously close to your crotch; but don't feel threatened. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? 

Sure. Swine flu has already had the best of all of us; but what you don't know is that it's extremely harmless......well at least to all of us who can pay our premiums on time. Of course though, I was lucky enough to survive such epidemics despite my vulgar yet fat-filled diet of the occasional Tibetan limb dipped in corrupt bias. (I know, I know......it'll get better)

Regardless, I AM a living survivor which means that I CAN help you if ever the chance happens you catch such an unfortunate virus. Accuracy however is not an important issue and should not be considered when following my advise, even if my name appears on a certain "10 of the hottest gay hookers" list. (NOW it get's better)

So i guess the one big question remains: How do i contract this so-called "Swine flu"?

Apart from your daily routine of having sex with that poor little piggy kept chained to the kitchen (along with your wife), it's quite unlikely that you'll 'catch' this disease from pigs. Along with this, it's also highly unlikely that you'll catch this virus from Jewish people, you're local vegan hippie or any other hated minorities. Which begs your response: Answer the original fucking question Julius!

Swine flu has been known to be more prone towards children; kind of like your neighbourhood stalker only that it doesn't take pictures of your son during the night. Instead it creeps upon your children like a flush of sea into their insides; violating their ever-so weak immune system. But hey!; let's look on the bright side: At least unlike a stalker, the only thing white sticky you'll be cleaning is their nose! 

Fortunately though, Swine flu acts like any other flu which means it can be transmitted through sneezing or any other kinds of physical bodily fluid contact (In other words, getting sneezed on by that hot chick on the tram and groping her = swine flu). This also includes pashing your best friend's dog and sleeping with your dead sister, even if you deny it. 

Here's a certain list of scenarios you SHOULD avoid:

- Your bimonthly tonguing session with an illegal Mexican immigrant, not only because she has a moustache, but also because it's unhygenic. In fact, It's probably cheaper if you just pay a homeless guy instead.

- Turkey slapping someone while having a piece of bacon 'strapped' to your 2 inch "pole of wonder".

- Eating up vomit containing any bite-sized chunks of bacon; including re-digested semen from last night's "wild party out".

- Licking your ex-girlfriend's period stain from within the inside of her pants, even if your local GP tells you otherwise. 

- Praising your son for barely passing P.E. units 1 and 2 before beating him up for being Swine flu positive. Instead, A nice dose of alleged 'death' may help the relationship; if not improve it from the "disgrace" it always was. In fact, return the 'stolen' child back to his original parents whom haven't seen their son for over 10 years because you abducted him from their backyard back in 1999. 

- Having sex with a loved one. Instead, head down to your local primary school (dressed up as Dorothy the Dinosaur of course); and who knows what you'll find! A teacher! That teacher's daughter! It really is a mixed bag of fun, waiting to be ruined by the individual that is you :)

- Reading anything ending with: Julius Reade

So as this lists suggests; your standard of living will most certainly crash into the bosom of an overweight broad, dressed in nothing but a tight 1950's lingerie traced with the unknown hairs of stray pubis (and beyond).......Assuming of course that you don't already have Swine flu.....

But what's that i hear you saying? You have Swine flu? Oh well. What a shame! because you were probably going to die anyway, not that anyone cares. I guess you'll only have a few days to live, but in the mean time please do read my few remaining options:

1. Pass the disease onto as many people as possible before suffering a painful death (as intended).

2. Die the American way! Eat yourself to death at your local McDonald's before the Flu kills you first.

3. Impregnate the Olsen twin that doesn't look like a horse.......oh wait........don't they both look like.......

4. Stop reading this guide and enjoy life!!!!

Life's short people. Let's not make this sentence any longer.....

"Another successful attempt. Clean draft. Happy :) About an hour spent writing. I'm enjoying this new style, although i don't think i prefer it value wise. Good commercial style though. I kind like sacrificing good writing for more imported jokes :)"
