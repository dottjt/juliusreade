Call me crazy, but i like to murder little children. No, I don't think It's not wrong to stab a knife into the back of a 4 year old, even if she begs you NOT TO. However, I can't stand it when a parent comes up to me with their dead son, accusing me of killing their child. It's not like i did it on purpose, i just happened to have an Ak-47 aimed at your sons head, when really i was trying to shoot the guy behind him. Then with my new pair of Adidas sneakers, attempted to clean the dog turd i had earlier stepped in, by stepping all over your son's face. Do you not realise what a pain it is to clean fresh blood stains and dog shit, with the back of your sons head? It's not like i intended to hurt him, I was just trying to have some fun*, i was just joking around if you know what i mean. Now before you go off and call the police, may i please assure you that i did it for the child's and parents sake, not for my own entertainment *cough*. Although, a more approiate statement would be: "I don't actual kill small children, this is a joke".

What isn't a joke however, is the rising cost of essential items, from a day-to-day basis. How am i suppose to have sex now, when a packet of Extra Large condoms cost $56, when i can barely pay for the rent, let alone for that Asian hooker in the first place? So how the hell are you going to cope in times like these? Are you just going to let the price of petrol murder you financially (metaphorically speaking)? Or do we decide to cut back on some of the things we love, like beating up your parents for sex, or cancelling your Foxtel subscription, despite the fact you have no TV?

Remember the good old days before the price of petrol was $70 a litre and you could leave a tap on ALL day, without feeling guilty. Those were a good time, but things have since changed and we're all eventually going to die!!!!!!! "Oh no, Julius, I don't want to die!!!! How don't i die?". Excellent question, and to answer that question, let us continue on to the next paragraph..................

So assuming that you want to live, you're going to have to cut back spending on useless services and products. One of the most wasteful costs inlvoved with 'living' is the food we eat, day and night. Why spend Hundreds of dollars on food, when we could be spending it on a third mortage or a new Russian wife? I find that spending $20 on food (Over a 3 month period) for the average family (2 adults 2 children), is more than enough to survive in todays society. If you really want to save money, then may i suggest you canabalise your neighbours, although it's going to be difficult trying to convince them to step into the big wok. (Hahahahahahaha...........*sigh*. It seemed funny on paper).

Why live in a warm, comfortable house, when you could be sleeping outside in the miserable rain, as a bird takes a dump on your face and annoyingly chrips throughout the night? With a rising cost in rent and property, you'll realise how much happier you'll be, sleeping out on the streets, as apossed to worrying about paying off your 2nd mortage in your king sized bed, probably with hooker. Soon, you'll be saving thousands of dollars from selling off all your old furniture and even your pets, although they do make a good snack when eaten raw.......?

Don't you just hate kids and want to rip their stupid little heads off and sell their individual body parts for half of want their worth? Well now you can (Apart from the whole 'cutting them up, and killing them thing'), because children cost a hell of a lot more than their useful for. From the top of my head, I'd say that your kids are worth almost nothing, but for the sake of profit, you'll be lucky to settle for $5, for that ugly 'piece-of-shit', also known as your daughter 'Sarah'. Or if you're a complete retard and have had more than one child, you might want to make an appealing deal, perhaps "5 for $20", "Buy one get the rest free" or "If you don't take my kids, I'm going to rape yours!..." (The last one is a risk, but it might just work). While you're at it, it doesn't hurt to sell off a few unwanted relatives (Mother-in-law, Wife etc.) including that bitch-ugly sister of yours, whom will never get laid..........

Now that you've hopefully saved up a couple of cents from following my advise, may i suggest you spend that money on gambling or booze, to help recover from all your misery from living inside a dumpster, eating half-used syringes for dinner. Oh well, so maybe it wasn't as benefitial as you thought it would be, but at least your not dead. Or, if you've saved up enough money, you can spend your 'earnings' on drugs and become a drug obsessed crazed man from the future. Thus leading me to my next guide, 'How to get your life, back on track'.............................
