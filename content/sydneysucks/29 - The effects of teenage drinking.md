Everyday before i go to bed, I'm sure to have at least 5 litres of pure alchol to help me get to sleep. Then when I'm feeling a little peckish, I'm sure to have a 6-pack by MYSELF and enjoy the forced belly dancing from some girl I've abducted into my household. So what exactly are the effects of teenage drinking? Well, not too good from the sign of things. Here are just a few FACTS:

It can lead to health problems: Unlike smoking and sniffing cocaine, alchol is the only known drug that can lead to health problems. In fact, you're more likely to end up hospital from over exposure to my jokes, than you are from a life of drinking and potential living. Not that i advise you to drink unless if it's from my personal range of 80% alchol spirits, found in the dark alleyway of your prefered supermarket.

Drinking is too cool for me: Being the 'anti-drinker' type, i'll usually try to stay away from the booze and substitute for something a little lighter, like softdrink or a nice tray of crystal-meth. Nothing beats the crap out of your organs like a nice tray of crystal-meth, promising only pain and misery in your later years, much like what drinking does. But look on the bright side.......................uh, just enjoy your life while it lasts* :) Or perhaps you might like a sample of cleaning fluid or detergent. In no time you'll be feeling 120% after a nice glass of Pino-clean, when really you realise that it's just your chance of dying.............

Drinking is for hippies: Those god damn hippies with their stupid pony tails and their mother-f**king attitude to always tell me to "Chill out". There are only 2 things that hippies are good for: Killing and Making fun of. I remember when i killed my first hippie, I was only 5 and my dad handed me the shawn off shotgun and he said: "Pull the trigger son, go make me proud"......and i pulled that trigger and i landed a perfect headshot, allegedly killing an ALREADY DEAD SOUL. Why do you think they Drink and smoke marajuana anyways? To try and get over their sorrows for being a god damn hippie!!!!!! So, please absorb my propaganda and take my agenda which is too eliminate the Jews!!!!!!!!! (WTF???? Oh well, i hate them both..........)

Well, now that we've looked on the all-so-horrible side of drinking, let's take a turn of pace and dulge into the positives........

It can lead to health problems:

Tim: Hello brother, how has your day been>?
B2: Excellent, I just slept with my best friend, while contracting heart disease, not to mention the great forplay afterwards.
Tim: What..........you contracted Heart disease!!! Oh no, you're such an idiot, you haven't been drinking again have you? 
B2: Haven't you been listening, I just slept with my best friend.......
Tim: I told you to stop drinking you fool, why didn't you take my advise?
B2: My best friend is a guy.........
Tim: What will be Mum's reaction when she finds out??? This doesn't look good.
B2: I don't think you're listening properly, I just had sex with my best friend who's a guy..............
Tim: .....that's great and all, but you have heart disease, have you seen a doctor????
B2: ...........just get out......
Tim: why.........
B2: .........Just get the fuck out.......
Tim: Hey, at least i don't have heart dies...... *B2 interrupts*
B2: GET THE FUCK OUT!!!!!!!
Tim: What a loser........
Mother: Boys, I've just got to go out and have sex with my best friend. I've left some dinner in the pantry. Don't stay up too late boys.
Tim: OK Mum. Bye............B2, don't be rude and say goodbye to Mum, it's only her first time....
B2: *Oh lord*, What the fuck is wrong with my family?????

Drinking is too cool for me: Uh, this isn't positive is it? What the hell, this isn't even a point.............Why the hell am i just repeating the negative? I'm such a fucking idiot!!!!

Drinking is for hippies: Hmmm........I guess it's sort of funny if you're a hippie? Well, not really.......I don't even know what the hell I'm talking about. Nothing much i can do now......

OK people, so the whole "positive section" is completely stuffed and doesn't even make sense, which means that teenage drinking IS BAD FOR YOU, even if professionals say otherwise. So what are you waiting for? Put down that beer bottle and put it to good use and throw it at the hippie next to you!!!!!!!!!
