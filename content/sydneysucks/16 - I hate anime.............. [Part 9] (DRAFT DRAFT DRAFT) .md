Anyone who remotely knows me, would know that i really hate anime. I can't help it, it's just there to be hated. Or more so, there's no reason to like it. 'Oh look, it's a girl with massive juggs and a cute voice'. You may as-well call it soft porn. But at the same time, i don't mind a bit of soft porn, so maybe should i watch anime, or should i go to redtube.com instead? Actually, it's sort of like the bits in a porno with the corny dialogue, and you just wanna fast-forward to the good bits, only that there ARE NO GOOD BITS.

The great thing about having anime though, is the fact that it's awful presence gives me something to write about. I just think it's the worst thing ever. However, worse than anime itself, is the hardcore anime fan. Now in the past, I've talked about different ways and methods to fend off these so-called 'people', but let me teach you a further method, also known as pain. Once an age-old tradition, now can be used by the stupidist of idiots including yourself.

What is pain? How is it created? Why the hell are you reading this? These are all good questions, but first, let's start off with a couple of methods that i find useful to inflict pain. Usually, if you just grab a blunt object and shove it into their neck, pain and often death will occur, however our objective is not to kill the victim, but to instead leave them in a state of near-death. Allegedly, n think.........

What if you can't find a blunt object? In that case, you may want to carry around a semi-automatic and shoot the crap out of anime bitch 1#, as she quote's lines off 'Bleach' to try and relieve pain. Too pussy to carry a gun? Then make good use of your arms, and easily knock over the mind-controlling anime comic, they're currently reading. Resulting into a never-ending siezure, or death and evil thoughts and you steal their wallet, and/or credit card.

Or perhaps you might want to "Choose your own adventure?". Close your eyes and blindly stab your victim to death with a tent peg, until you get blood all-over your face? No?, Well then why not try using an anime comic, to papercut their eyelids, collecting the blood they cry out and selling it to a blind person as a cure? Not a fan of blood?, Then with an electric drill, how about drilling their eyes to the back of their head, using only your index finger, and palm of your hand? Can't afford the price of electricty?, Then how about shoveling their head into the ground, as the whole family watches his legs move about crazily in mid-air? Don't own a shovel?, Then how about pushing your 'new anime friend' into an oncoming bus, filled with Russian tourists? Don't live in Russia, or own a bus?, Then how about setting their body on fire, by throwing a molotov cocktail to the back of their head? Now come on, who the hell doesn't have an emergency molotov cocktail, ready to be lit?
