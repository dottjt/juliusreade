Apart from my terrible grammar and non sensitivity, I've realised that my writing is very repetitive and often tedious. Although my writing style varies from a story to a near-factual article, it seems that the jokes and subject stay the same. Now this either can be viewed as a bad thing or good thing. Most authors in fact are very repetitive in the way they describe and comment things, with the big difference that they actually having meaning and story behind they're articles, whereas i make all this shit up from scratch. Unfortunately this means that it has no real meaning to anyone, which would explain a lack of readership. Although i instead use my very witty and future proof jokes and comedy stylings as a drawing point to this blog.

But back to my readership, the one reason why i have so little frequent readers (If any) is because my articles can't exactly relate to anything. OK, so maybe they do, but they aren't topics would generally think of. How does this relate to my overall readership? One word, Google. Who on the hell is going to type in 'Sydneysucks' or 'Mastacating the truth' into google? To prove my point, if you merely type 'Mastacating' int google, the fourth link is this very blog. Yet people don't really care about that word, so why would they bother typing it into google, let alone visiting this blog. So what am i going to do about it?

Nothing. Unlike my first attempt 'Adelaidesucks', I've decided to keep this project low. Now I'm not suggesting that i don't endorse the wonderful content that this blog provides, but i just don't want to be the one endorsing it. By all means endorse it to others yourself, in fact I'd appreciate it, although i have no reason to. Why do i need more people stealing my jokes and ideas, and fucking them up in the process. Besides, I don't think that others finding out will help. Otherwise, i enjoy the works posted on this blog and treat it as my development as a human. The blog is not personally based which is a bad thing on the behalve of avid fans, although I'm sure they don't exsist anyway. In fact I've come a long way since Last October, which would be an early anniversary. (October 31st)

The great thing i think about my articles is that there isn't any unhelpful descriptive crap that ruins the whole atmosphere to make jokes. It's probably the reason why girls aren't funny. All they have is a description to tell, not an actual joke.

http://www.wtfis.com/, is a perfect example of the pure crap, found easily accessible from Google. Simply, it's bullshit packed into the vicinity of an article. The dude clearly knows nothing about making a joke, as apposed to his own stupid experiences as a person. It happens all the time, 'so-called comics' whom only recall their own experiences, without making any actaul jokes. It's one thing to tell a story, but it's another to tell a joke. In other words, he's actually mocking himself (His own life) to 'try' and make people laugh? That is the attitude of a loser, which is probably what 'he' is. 

Now i know in defense you'd probably say that my articles are utter crap, which is why I'd tell you to watch shows like "Two and a Half men" or maybe "Wipeout" to help arouse your feeble needs. Now there are two main reason why this article isn't funny. 1, it's intention is to be informative not funny and 2, I'm being too descriptive in the way i comment and explain things. I need more 'events/jokes' if that makes any sense to you. When you tell a story, you want it to be descriptive, which is what makes it interesting and memorable. When you tell a joke, you want it to be easy to understand and short lasted, although memorable. Which is why I'm going to have to end this article on a short note. In fact, I'm going to have to write a quick comedy sketch to over come the seriousness I've created. Actually, I better not..........
