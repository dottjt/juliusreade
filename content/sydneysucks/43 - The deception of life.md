I guess the problem with humans, is the fact that we can't prove every fact in the world. We can't explain how life began, we still don't know how the universe works let alone many aspects of our own planet, and even if we did it'd be depressing because it's nothing "Ultimate" or "Special". It's because of this 'lack of knowledge' that people feel depressed and hopeless. If only people knew how to explain EVERYTHING......

In most cases, people feel depressed because they get confused about life and what is has to offer, and this usually overwhelms them. So what is it that one does when they can't come up with the answer to life? They go insane or more often than most kill themselves. Yet why haven't you and me killed ourselves yet?

It's simple: Distractions. However let's take this a step backwards first and answer how one person begins to feel depressed. 

Unfortunately, THINKING is the ultimate culprite. When we think, it exposes us to rational thinking, our supposed 'best friend'. Yet when we simply can't explain 'EVERYTHING', we begin to become depressed and lose hope. 

However, when we are distracted by life's qualms we forget to think about some of life's "more important questions". It's these distractions that put our mind off these questions and thus rendering us happy and resolute. I'd consider religon to be a form of distraction.

Yet what if you're like me and you're begining to find life tedious, in the sense that you don't enjoy to do anything anymore, you have no purpose. What if when you manage to over come these distractions, and can't help but think? 

This is the very question I've been trying to ask myself for a long while now. 

As a human being I'm smart enough to know that religon is a load of bs, yet it's so benefitial to the human spirit and mind. However, i do have a small solution: To create a rational god/figure.

I've realised that although I've been absent of a god, I've actually had a god all along. Not as a some superior being, but as a person I've admired. She was a my distraction.
