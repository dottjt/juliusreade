I wasn't much of a failure at school (debatable), so why are your children? Why is it that your son 'sucks dick' at school and isn't popular? Is it because he's such a girl and loser? Or is it because he's a complete wanker and has no friends? Either way, he's still a loser and always will be............unless if he follows my advise. After my ten week program involving harm punishments for being physically unattractive, learning new and dangerous sexual maneuvers and possibly a bit of drug and hooker action. So what are you waiting for, throw me your credit card, and let's get started!!!!!!!!!!!

As a kid, i had to make many regretful decisions, all of them involving my future career in some way or another. "Do i decide to sell drugs to the year 12 students, or do i study in the libray and become a rich surgeon?", with my wise decision to allegedly supply cocaine to a pack of untrustworthy Year twelves at XXX highschool. Now although I essentially ruined my life, as the policeman guided me to my prision celll for selling illict substances, I still manged to make no friends, including repect from my fellow peers.


Soon, your son/daughter will be the coolest kid in school, with a gun in one hand (batteries not included) and a hot girl in the other.

Conditions apply: No losers. No wimps. No girls and/or boys. No old people. Should already be popular with classmates and must personally know at least 10 hookers, drug dealers and rapists. Should know how to perform 'The reverse cowgirl' or Dirty Sanchez'. Must have at least 5000 Myspace friends."
