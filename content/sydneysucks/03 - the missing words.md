Back in the office, one of my co-workers asked me what the word 'happiness' meant, but i didn't have a clue. None of our friends could figure it out too, but it somehow reminded me of my wife and kids. If only they were still alive.

I spent all of today trying to figure out the particular word, but still no clue. I tried looking it up in the dictionary, but it wasn't there. I guess some things will just remain a mystery, although I'm sure that the word was just made up. Yes, that's right, it was all just a prank. I'll get that bastard!!!! I'll make up words too, like 'joy' and 'anger'. Yes, that will teach that bastard to mess with my emotions................
