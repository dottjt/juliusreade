The Xbox 360. Although pretty and rather cute with all it's misguiding and sexually attractive colours, the Xbox 360 fails to deliver entertainment to a high standard, as opposed to the greatness of the Wii. So why hate the Xbox? Is it because I think Bill Gates is a complete fucktard and I'm just biased, or perhaps there's more to whole story................

But first you must be asking yourself, "Why the fuck am i reading this?". Is it because you're a poor little fucker that can't afford all 3 consoles? Or has your conservative side told you that having a Wii would make you look like a complete retard in front of all my your cool friends. Well, playing video games is already an indication that you have no friends, so let's talk no further and explain the Xbox 360 in full detail................

Xbox 360: Apart from having a shit name, the Xbox 360 is a completely useless machine, created from melted down computer parts and Tibetan people, (sourced from China). Ok, so maybe it seems a little cooler than the Wii, but what other console allows you to illegally play games while not having the difficulty and complication of security............that's right, the Wii. Not suggesting anything about my personal life......

Aside from being about as useful as a blind man having sex with a crack in the ground, the Xbox 360 has a massively improved version of the Pentium III processor, overclocked at 1.6 Gigahertz of potential power*. This is happily backed up by it's maximum potential of post-1996 graphics, with it's 3 MB Nvidia graphics card, capable of running the original Super Mario, and other such titles. But don't worry yet, because with 5 KB of ram you'll be happily surfing the Xbox 360's one option Menu (Turn off console) and doing your homework (WTF)????, all with Microsoft's new and improved peripherals for the Xbox 360, including Microsoft's number pad deluxe (Capable of adding together a maximum of two, three digit numbers) and Logitec's Multi-button controller (Compatable with Halo. The only game anyone remembers).

One of the highlights of the Xbox 360, would include it's highly attractive physical look. However, please do ignore the 'radioactive sign' in fine print, on the back of the console. It's all a bloody hoax from a bunch of fascists. As if you'd believe the International Agency of Health and Social care, fking it's their fault the Xbox 360 contains five-out-of-six forbidden toxic metals (Although mostly the mixture of Untrustworthy, Anti-Chinese, Fascist Tibetans). Why don't you all just fucking die in a stupid fucking box, and rot to hell with your usless, fucking, piece of shit brain. Bitch*. However, whats a console without a partially-working controller, now introducing the new Xbox 360 wired controller, exactly the same as the original Xbox controller, only with a built in speaker, constantly reminding you to buy Microsoft products, through subliminal messages and swearing. But the people at Microsoft aren't that stingy, now including 50% more lead in all their products, including Microsoft's new product, "Lick a Lead "(For Xbox 360 and PS3?). With this product, you'll be able to lick your way through such games as Halo and...........Halo, by licking a lead pipe, filled with all that lead goodness. Don't like the taste of lead? Well, now introducing "Lick a Sulfur", where you'll be able to lick your way through games like Halo and...........Halo and possibly.............the start menu.

Sam, 15: "But what If i want to invite friends over to play Halo with me?". Shit question dickhead, because you won't have any friends after the embarrassment of buying this piece of crap (Referring to the Xbox 360, not your credibility. {Ouch, Snap!!!!}), now including one player multiplayer, against yourself!!!!! For the first time ever in history, the Xbox 360 user can now play games WITH HIM/HERSELF in the comfort of ones home. Be the envy of the playground, as your friends watch you play Halo 3, although they'll probably out clubbing and picking up chicks, while constantly getting getting laid...............But who cares!!! Your only 40 years old and you've still got plenty of time to pay girls for sex...............

With slightly over 15 games on the Xbox 360, you're sure to have a classic time with all 15 editions of Halo (Editions may include, different regions, different languages and minor changes to audio. Basically there's only one game for Xboxx 360, and that's Halo). But don't be intimidated by the Xbox 360's large range to family friendly games (Halo is rated 'R 18+' to 'AO', depending on country and region), because with the Xbox's ability to read DISC media (Excludes CD-R, DVD-R, Blue ray, HD-DVD-R and any other media. Basically anything with data on it) , you'll be having the time of your life, listening back to Avril Lavine's first album........although why the hell do you have anything by Avril Lavine, let alone one song by Avril Lavine?

Sam, 15 "Wow!!!!!! I'm completely convinced by your alleged mockery of the Xbox 360. Where the fuck can i get one?" Sam.......are you fucking retarded? And how dare you swear on my blog, especially when kiddies could be reading this. You're and absolute disgrace and you should really behave yourself. Seriously, cut out the fucking bad language, cause it doesn't make you look cool and furthermore if you keep acting the way you have been throughout this whole article, I'm just going to have to cut you out all together. Fuck.............Like seriously, what a complete dickhead. Fucking retard.........

..........Oh, where were we? Oh that's right, the Xbox 360 is available in most unprofitable stores, ranging from Big W to Big W. Now i know you really want to buy one at this very moment, but unless if you can cough up $5,000 dollars (Excludes controllers, packaging, cables. If i remember correctly, the console is an added bonus), you're just going to have to buy a Wii.........or if your really desperate, wait for my next review on the PS3, which will most likely NOT going to happen...................yet. The End................

................Wait, Wait, Wait a second!!??! This isn't the end yet!!!!! I could have sworn that i heard somebody mentioned the word "Fun"? Because If i heard correctly, you should get a girlfriend instead, and none of these socially unattractive consoles........But what can i say, I'm still a virgin (Sorta, if you Don't include rape, relatives and neighbours).........

I guess that's what i should do then............nah" "Wow, this article is packed with jokes..........now it's your turn to discover them. This is a really good article, if you're not into getting offended and stuff. The Chinese government will thank me for that Tibetan joke after the toxic metals."
