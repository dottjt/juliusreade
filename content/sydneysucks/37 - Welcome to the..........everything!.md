I guess this is kinda the statement that sums up the entire branch of blogs that make up the..........collection, I'd guess you'd call it. Unfortunately, I don;t erite anymore articles on a regualr constant base, although usually every month or so I'll have this massive urge to write some more articles, lasting only 4-5 articles; even less. Why? Because when i started writing on these collections of blogs i decided to have no writing influence AT ALL. What this meant, was that i didn't have anyone to guide me to how to write well, or the best techniques to write. Unlike what my art teacher told me: "You should always research and get influences before you create art", I find that although you'll probably do better if you do follow that advise, it'll in fact destroy the originality of the art that in fact makes it yours. If you follow someone elses technique, then it isn't really entirely yours. However, it if you decide to take a stab in the dark and write something that hasn't been influenced, then it'll be better remembered as your own style and influence.

Although, you certainly get to a point where you discover that your technique (No matter how good, simple or enjoyable) is inferior to the actual "Correct" way of doing it. Anyways, if you're managed to reach this site, then good luck and et.c
