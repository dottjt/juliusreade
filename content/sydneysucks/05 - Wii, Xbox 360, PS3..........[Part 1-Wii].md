You may as well call me an arsonist, although i hate playing with fire. It just isn't fun to light a match in the vicinity of your home, and then look at it. It's initially what you do with the 'lit match' that gets you all worked up and excited. I'm sure that you could do lots with an ignited match, weither you decide to eat the lit match or burn out both your friend's eyes with a magical 'two headed match', fun can and will be had. However, setting your friends hair on fire isn't the only way to have fun.

Buying a Wii, Xbox360, PS3 and to a lesser extent, Atari 2600 can be a very fulfilling investment, promising to provide 'hundreds of hours' of intellectual entertainment. So where can i get one Julius?

Hold your horses buddy! Based on the fact that you're reading this crap and have no social experience in life (an accurate assumption), you probably can't afford all three consoles, let alone one. So which one will you buy? The console with no number in it's title? The console with the highest number? Or the console representing the number of friends you have?

Wii: Apart from the fact that i own a Wii and think that it's the best console ever, I'm willing to say that the Wii is the only console you should buy. Allegedly, it has a 8.4 Gigahertz processor* with 17 Quad cores* running all at full speed, which compared to the other consoles, makes the PS3 and Xbobx360 look like a piece of crap. Also, with a 6 GB GPU*, the Wii has a higher resolution than real life, which has a lot to say about it's technology. In addition, it's compatabile with PS3* and Xbox360 games*, so what else do i need to say? Well, It can connect to the internet from any access point from 500 km* away, and can support over 120 person online multiplayer*. Not good enough? It's so powerful it can act as a printer*, laser turret*, Girlfriend/Boyfriend*, Brain surgeon* and even as a desktop PC*, not to mention the millions of never-ending apps and undiscovered uses*. The Wii can also be used as a multimedia powerhouse*, supporting upto 500 Terrabytes of data* on the new unreleased HDDDD Green-ray disk format*. But how about the games and etc>?

The Wii unsurprisingly has over 2 million games* to choose from, not to mention the crap ones that exist on the PS3 and the other one (Xbox410 i think, but who cares?). Q: "Hey Julius, I have a social life and video games are for losers. Why should i get a Wii?". Good question, Thank god for the Wii's revolutionary technology, because the Wii supports 60-person local multiplayer*, which will transform those boring, booze drinking parties, into a fun event to remember. Not only will this eliminate the problem of having to wait to play your turn, but the Wii also features a built in 'Cable TV' feature*, which lets you watch Cable TV for free*, excluding any hidden and actual costs!!!!!!!!!!!! So how much does it cost overall?

I think you'll be surprised to know that the Wii only costs a mere $400* (Excludes any Controllers, Online services, Games, Internal apps, Firmware, Packaging, including any actual hardware)!!!!!!!!!!! That's only $400 for so many services that all just are simply irresistible, and yet the Wii is so cheap. Usually, you'll find that the average Wii game costs around $12*, although they can be illegally downloaded from the Internet, and why wouldn't you? Wii games are so popular, it's just impossible to buy a copy of the exclusive* to Wii "GTA 5: Shanghai"* when you realise that EB is always out of stock*, due to popularity*.

I think the ultimate question is, "Do you want to have the Best-damn*, Fking orgasmic*, Best frigging awesome*, Super fantantasic*, Better than sex*, Never-ending* time of your life!!!!!!!!" Because if you do, i highly suggest that you buy a Wii now, and live your life to its fullest...........

*Perhaps not true, Nonfactual, Uncertainty, Possibly opinionated. Best you just 'ignore' the asterix warnings ;)
