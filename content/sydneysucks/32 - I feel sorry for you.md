"Look at yourself with that 5.8 haircut, with a slice of 3.4 gayness. Hell, i know I'm only worth 8.5, but to hell with your 4.8!!!!!!!", God damn it, i don't have time for this.......

I don't understand why he just can't stay away from me. I mean, i know he's my brother and everything but he really pisses me off, mainly the way he treats me. I can feel him touching my hair, but i don't know what to say. It's just really damn irritating but I can't answer him back, how could I? Actually, i think i might tell him, it's really getting annoying. "Say Tim,............"

Oh no, what on Earth have i done now? Shit, i don't have time for this, I'm just going to have to leave him like this for now. I just can't stand to see him like this, It drives me fucking crazy up the wall. Crap my phone's ringing but fuck it, i don't have time to pick it up. "Thanks for the coffee Tim..........."

Thank god that crap is over, i can finally get under the task in hand. Now where did i park that car, oh there it is behind the Peugeot. I really hate my brother, he's such a psychological tool. He makes you feel all small inside, although he's the true retard and he knows it. What the hell is that small child doing there on the side of the road, the stupid bitch. "Get the fuck off the road!!!............"

Oh shit, i think she's crying, but i don't really care. Fuck, I knew i shouldn't have said it, but she could have seriously hurt herself. Stuff it, It's too late now, and I'm closing in on the warehouse anyways. I think i might turn up the radio, it boosts my confidence. "The body is still fresh Sir..............."

The fresh air feels good on my face, especially when it's wet. You haven't lived until you've experience fresh air on your face. It's like Ecstasy, you just feel great inside when it happens. Gosh, Dad doesn't look too happy, I don't understand why, i did him what he asked me to do. "Whats the matter Dad.............."

Shit man, i wish he would please put the gun down. It's not like i hate my Dad or anything, but i don't think he's feeling too good at the moment. He already killed a guard, and me shot he in the leg twice. I don't know whats gotten into him, I thought he'd be happy. Maybe he doesn't love me anymore? Meh, fuck him, he's never been very useful anyways. "\**Bang**............................."

I seriously didn't know what i was doing, i though he was the enemy. Bullshit, what kind of an excuse is that. The lie of a fool i say. At least i don't have children to blame it on, let alone a wife. I really wonder. I wonder what Dad's feeling. "\**Bang**...................internal darkness."
