Video games used to be fun, until now. Playing 'Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08' is like getting your face blended and crushed simultaneously, while you best friend repeatedly stabs a screwdriver into neck, as some unknown maniac drowns your face into a wok of pre-heated tar with knifes stuck on the edges, piercing through your skull and brain, as your head is repeatedly dunked into the wok.......................although slightly impractible.

Never have a played such a crap game in my whole life, that fails to deliver in every aspect. It's not even a 'game' for all i care, It's more like the death of a loved relative, in the form of a dvd. Damn, I'd rather have herpies on my face and have 'I rape my daughter' tattooed on my forehead (Not true. I really don't want herpies. Although the tattoo idea sounds kinda.....sexy. [Also not true.]), than own a copy of this game. Even if they're giving away free copies at EB, just don't take it, unless if there's a bin nearby. It's sort of like losing your virginity to an ex-war veteran, living inside a dumpster by Safeway as he hastily takes another bite from his half-eaten Drum stick. Unless of course if you like that sort of thing, from which i beg you to please stop reading this blog, as it deeply creeps me out.

Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is nothing like golf, instead it's more like having your lungs punctured by lead thumbtacs, as a grenade explodes in your face. There's like 4 courses*, all of them exactly the same, just with different names (allegedly) and no menu options (Another alleged fact and/or opinion). The graphics are worse than Tetris on the Nintendo DS, and yet i reviewed PS3 version of the game. I mean, how stupid do they think i am? Very stupid indeed, for even bothering to buy this piece of crap, although mostly made up of plastic and other chemicals, as apposed to stuff that comes out of your 'you-know-where', and am forced to eat, from one of my many fathers requests..............

OK, so maybe it was $5 in the bargain bin at Big W, and perhaps i was a slightly intoxicated and possibly hiding from the police, for beating up my 5 year old daughter, but It's not really my fault. Personally, i blame EA for releasing this horrid game and my bitch daughter "Sarah" for not wanting to be beaten to death for allegedly 'not sucking harder enough' and for her stupid mother for teaching her to dial the State Emergency number.

Apart from everything else involved with this game , Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is just a crap experience, even when drunk. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, even to any avid golf fans, although golf is naturally a crap sport anyway, which would explain your unpopularity message to golf fans out there). But I'd must admit that getting my face 'kicked in' by my sisters ex-boyfriend for trying to hit on his mother, was much more entertaining than trying to hit a 3-bit virtual ball into a 1-bit virtual hole. Not the mention the daily beatings i recieve from my sexually confused grandfather and the threesome afterwards. Good times :)

PS: I hope the developers of this game (allegedly) drown themselves in a room filled with "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08" disks, eventually dying from the bad quality of the game, as apposed to having a lack of 'breathable' air (The stench on bad quality).

PSS: I'm really sorry for those really bad jokes, but i just couldn't help myself.

--------------------------------------------------------------

- Graphics: 0.5/10 - At least it was slightly better than that gay porn i had to watch with my blind cousin 'Richard'. Just joking, it was actually with my brother 'Abilo' and we were actually creating gay porn with dodgy cam work. C'mon, i insisted to hold the video recorder, but he was just too 'busy with his hands'. (Sorry about the lameness of the last joke, as withe this entire article).

- Sound: 0/10 - That 'Mute button' can work wonders :)

- Gameplay: 10/10 - ..........and if by 'Gameplay', you mean throwing the Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 disk at your brothers forehead, cutting his face into tiny 'bite-sized' pieces.

- Lasting Appeal: 0/10 - None, let alone any appeal.

- Any reason to live anymore: 0/10 - That's 10 minutes of my life I'll never get back.
