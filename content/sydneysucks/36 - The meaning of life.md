Finally after weeks and weeks of confusion, frustration, uselessness and determined thinking, I have come to my senses and discovered the meaning behind why i should continue living, and not instead kill myself. I felt hopeless, i felt that despite everything i possessed (Including "Myself") i simply had no purpose in life worth living. With this in mind though, I knew that there was hope, because previously in my younger years i had felt happy and unconditional with my current state in life.

I could not decide about anything in life, weither it be music, movies or videogames due to the overwhelming choice and avaliability of the subject. I had an undetermined obligation to fulfil everything in life, although that simply wasn't possible due to obvious time constraints and situation reasons. This isn't the main issue and never was, as so i discovered.

Soon after dismissing the possibility of my confusion being towards choice, i moved elsewhere, into the era of learning. Learning i thought, would improve the person i am and provide self-fulfilment. In many ways, this could be the ultimate answer, solving the problems of billions of people around the world. In this case, we must look beyond what we can and should do.

Then after days and days of more tedious thinking, i decided to look back at the past to see what made me really happy. Then i realised, it was simply a compassion for things in life, that made me want to live and express myself. Over time, compassion whas come and happily stayed, soon to be replaced by a newer compassion in life. What has happened is that the compassion has gone from my life, without being replaced by another compassion. The hope for compassion is what keeps us alive. It's like when people say that love is the most important thing in life. It's not the actual 'love' that is it important, but the compassion it carries.

When you think about it, everything relates back to compassion. If you live in poor conditions and decide to kill yourself, it won't be because of poor conditions nessecarily. It most likely will be due to the fact that you have no hope for compassion, which varies depending on opinion. Then again there are attributing outside factors, such as mental endurance and etc. etc. etc.

Why i bothered to try and do this? Well, it's school holidays at the moment, which is also when people tend to get bored with materialistic choice and the whole waiting for nothing to happen. Most people would know that boredom can often force people to start thinking about ideas and concepts that you wouldn't often think about if you were occupied. I guess you could say that boredom is essential to living a healthy and fulfiled life. I know it sounds a bit crazy, however if you can manage to get past the frustration and long hours thinking for a reason of your exsistence, then I'm sure you too can improve your life dramatically, in ways that only YOU can describe......

Just remember to look back at your compassions in life to further inspire yourself in life, when in doubt. In my case, i think it was because i was able to use my ipod in such a long time, who knows????

Try and be reasonable, which could mean absolutely anything :)
