I woke up. A dark, distorted voice speaks from the walls.

"Welcome. Please leave the car keys on the table designated by the late robot. It will arrive shortly, but please be patient, it was only created a day before the prespire. You are lucky to have survived the prespire, which will further increase your strength and ability to dodgy obstacles. In anycase, your newly aquired skills will help you achieve ultimate status over the people surrounding you. On the count of three, you must use your ability to kill them. Let me demonstrate."

A turret appears and kills the surrounding people. A bullet hits you, death awaits.
