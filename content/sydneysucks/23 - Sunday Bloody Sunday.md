Sunday Bloody Sunday, what to do? Usually if i have the time, I'll write an account of what i did during the past week. As you'll know, every day is different despite the rapid changes in society and such. Yesterday, i woke up; collected the fire wood; disposed my neighbour's corpse; eventually ending the day with a prayer and a smiling suspicion. Those damn neighbours of mine, always getting bombed by some sort of explosive or another. I really can't understand, but i just let it be. It's all i can do.........

I decided to look into the Yellow pages today because i had this damn leaking pipe. Water was just leaking everywhere and i got really mad. I began beating my wife with a piece of wood, which made me feel good again. The beating got harder and harder, but the screaming some how got louder. I figured that if i felt better, so would she but I'm she didn't seem too happy. Then the screaming got too loud which pissed me off, so i knocked her out for good. Perhaps i shouldn't have done it in front of the children?

For a good 5 minutes the children kept staring at me. I told them to stop, but they just kept looking, motionless. I continued by scraping her head along the carpet floor, telling her what a useless piece of shit she is, and i really meant it too. God i hate that bitch, i really do. If i could have it my way, I'd have all women killed and hung by a thick piece of string, for all men to see and perhaps wank off too. I soon preceded by nailing her arms to the floor, sexually screwing her all over in the face, leaving a stream of white and yellow stain across her face. It felt damn good. I'm sure my children will thank me one day..............

I could feel the happiness surge, I felt young and alive!! I stood up and plunged the mop into her throat, forcing blood to pour from her mouth. Her neck snapped into broken bone and skin and I could see her pain, as with my personal joy. I kicked and kicked and kicked, and nothing could describe the wonderful quantum of ecstatic pleasure. If only my children were here to seize the moment, so i gathered them up and strapped them to the couch, with a cup of milk and a biscuit; Both petrified as hell, but with a hint of thankfulness and appreciation, I knew i had done the right thing. But then it happened again: the children just wouldn't stop looking. The happiness wore away...........

I'd beat my children but i can't, I don't have the will. I mean, they're too innocent, they've done nothing wrong, I love them dearly. Nowadays, when i beat my wife she doesn't make a sound, not a single one. It's a good feeling, one that demonstrates control, authority and manhood, almost god-like. However my arms began to tire out, so i had a break and had a good look at my children. Boy, did they look beautiful, the most beautiful pair of children I'd ever seen. I could feel the connection between us, I knew that we were destined to be. If only i could preserve that beauty and prevent them from growing up to become the corrupt adults in everyday society. I pondered on the thought, but i didn't really pay attention. I thought it was time to put the children back into the alcohol-smelling cupboard, preserved for another daily routine......................
