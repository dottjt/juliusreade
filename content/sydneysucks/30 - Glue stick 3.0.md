I get real sick and tired of coming home to my wife of 5 years and realising that I've run out of Lube for 'the old fella down stairs', while i have cartons of glue sticks gathering up dust in the corner? What if i could some how combine the two multi-purpose items into one New* and Improved 2-in-1 Gluestick and Lube device? Well now you can, and we've done all the hard work for you and created the all New* and Improved Gluestick 3.0!!!!!

In the flick of a switch, your Gluestick will transform from a boring, original useless Gluestick, into a clear water based lube, also known as Gluestick 3.0!!!!!! Click the image for a closer look:

No more wanking empty handed, no more stickiness discomfort, and no more getting 'stuck' inside the opposite sex, because with Gluestick 3.0 you'll be having endless hours of tantalising fun, even after the contents of tube finishes, because the Gluestick 3.0 also functions as a mini C4 explosive!!!!!! Why? Well much like a dud memory, a dud root can often lead to later problems in life such as "Shut the fuck up" and "Tompkins Herpies", so why not destroy the memory, as with your loved one with one simple mechanism!!!! Simply pull the small trigger, shove the Gluestick 3.0 into the recipients mouth and watch your sex partners organs explode as the deadly Carbon Trioxide exposes her artery system to a Lifetime of DEATH. Never has it been so legal and easy to kill the love of your life, and the great thing is: That the police don't need to find out* ;)

So how much does it cost Mr. Julius?? Well, what a wonderful question because I'm not actually selling them due to the breach of over 5000 international and usually 'made-up' regulations. Now I'm not suggesting that my product is illegal and is possibly harmful to your internal and external organs, however i do advise all people under the age of 75 to stay away from my product at all costs, even if it means using your original Gluestick again!!! Now I'm certainly not suggesting that it causes Internal bleeding and Heart tumors after 25 hours of use, although I am suggesting that it is a great product that is almost certainly safe with children, especially those whom are already dead. In all truth, the product is available from your locally unofficially unauthorised pharmacist. Just simply go behind the counter while the store manager isn't looking and steal the big red box with the large radioactive symbol on the front and all the cautious labels warning you to dispose of this product. Simply ignore the warnings as they are not true! If the box doesn't have the "Made in China" sticker on it, it probably isn't safe to consume and should be burnt till only ashes and a glowing green powder remains. Otherwise, have fun with the Missus for an eternity, before the highly acidic chemicals rearrange the DNA in your body, rendering it useless for the next 500 years......
