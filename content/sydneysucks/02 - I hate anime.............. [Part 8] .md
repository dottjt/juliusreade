Whenever anybody makes a reference to anime or has the need to bring up Naruto in a conversation, I tell them to get fked and eventually I'll walk away. But sometimes, it's not that simple. What if they apologise and promise to give you $50? Do you take the money and thank them, or do you refuse their offer and stab out both their eyes with a bread knife? Both are eligible, both are effective, yet both are so wrong. Let me explain:

Anyone whom watches anime deserves far worse than a knife hanging from each eye, they more accurately deserve intensive recovery to bring back the good within, which is NOT to watch anime and more time playing with the family pet or fighting over who should get breast fed first. This 'alleged' procedure may involve unnecessary pain, taunting and possibly death, but at least they won't be watching episode 456 of "This is hentai in the disguise of anime".

So what's wrong with anime then? Absolutely everything if you ask me. It's gay, It promotes anti-Semitic ideas and possibly fascism, just take a look at Bleach. In one of the alleged episodes, the main guy (with shit orange hair) gives a miscarried baby a back-hander in the face and shoves each arm into a separate incinerator and blender simultaneously, while forcing a young girl to listen to 'my chemical romance'. In Sailor Moon, one of the girls in a tightly clad, yet visually illegal uniform, jumps out at another guy and gives him a 'Dirty Sanchez', although he probably isn't straight!!!!! In Love Hina, one of the hot girls cannibalizes an other one of the other hot girls, without having sex with the dead corpse before hand. In Pokemon, Ash hands out 'barely legal teen porn' to all his Pokemon, while he 'feels-up' his entire family with a pair of tweezers and packet of gloves. So if you don't call 'that' wrong, then I DON"T KNOW WHAT IS.

Ok, so maybe i made up SOME aspects of my story, but not EVERY aspect, adding further truth and accuracy to my statement. So do you take the $50, or do you physically hurt them with your weak-like 'skeletal' structure? Trick question people, you actually do both, although i don't advise it, especially to my younger audience. Because remember kids, knifes are dangerous and should only be used as a form of cutlery, so unless if your going to eat him/her, you shouldn't kill people with knifes!!!!! I personally, but allegedly find it a lot easier to kill people by paying other people to do it for you...........also known as a hitman. But if you can't afford to pay for one, ask for another hitman to kill that hitman, which will be a never-ending cycle of death and happiness.
