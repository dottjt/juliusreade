Summoning Beyond. You can chose to believe it. You can choose not to. You can even kill yourself with a deadly Sniper rifle or Mini gun. Or perhaps you fancy a gun shot to the face, by one of our highly trained specialists. Whatever you chose to do, be reminded by this story of no determination, no courage, and perhaps the complete opposite of what a good story should be. It contains no romance, violence, emotion, action, even comedy. So how is it a story then? Who knows? Guess I'm just going to have to tell you...................

Now I know your probably hoping for a great story, a wonderful story, but that simply isn't going to happen. Great stories usually involve pony's and cute little horses, but i can guarantee you that there are none this one. Although there might be a few references to the dead, the weakened, and possibly the feeble. As previously mentioned, it's a story without action, a story without love and certainly without adventure, so what is it about then? Well, just imagine if your lungs, heart, skin and everything but your brain just disappeared. Or more so deteriorated. How would you feel? Would you even feel anything? Let's find out...................

"Seamine laboratories are a respected corporation, fulfilling the needs of the people. Anyone whom disobeys, will be prosecuted and/or shot at first sight. If we don't catch you know, we'll most certainly catch you later. Disobeying orders, Not following orders and Mistreatment of higher or official authority are all subjects of disobedient behaviour, which will result in death or further inquiry. You now may enter........."

Seamine laboratories was a popular place among young folk. It pleased parents to know that their son was participating in such a loyal service, creating role models of young men. What made Seamine laboratories so great, was it's tendency to change the minds of young ones. One day, they'll be angry little critters, then all of a sudden, cheerful minds, striving towards excellence and futuristic ideas. No one till this day knows how it's done, as no one has ever returned from Seamine laboratories, by law. All but one. I'll tell you about that later.

It's entire operations surrounded the town, like some sort of cage, trapping the people within a giant glass sphere. No one is ever let out, unless if assigned to. We have no say in anything, in the fear of being disobedient, thus death. Death wasn't the only thing people worried. Random visitings from the guards are truly a terrifying experience. They'd come in and knock things over, especially at night. One time, they came in and destroyed the entire place, leaving me and my children to rest. But no one ever talked back to a guard, hoping to live a disturbed, but peaceful life.

As a kid, I'd remember watching the dedicated Seamine laboratories channel on the TV for it's outstanding services. Thinking to myself, "That place sounds great, so full of happiness and cheerfulness. I wouldn't mind going there myself." How i was all so wrong. As a kid, the corrupt government used to brainwash us kids in the hope to attract more recruits to their establishment. I, like many other children were convinced by such an evil corporation, until i was captured by rebels from the north, saving the life's of many children, including my 'weak' self. I didn't want to end up like the brainwashed people in town, living in a virtual world where everybody was happy. I knew that something was wrong, and i was going to find out................By the way, my name is Jack. Jack Mitchell. I can't tell you my real name.....................
