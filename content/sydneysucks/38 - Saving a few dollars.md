Back in the days, before women could talk in public and our profound obsession with cars and hookers once restricted to our sisters and extreme profanity; people were living happy, unrealised lives. But now in an age where we can't even afford to bribe that cheap little girl down at the local Kmart to come with you into your 4X4 car? It's truly terrifying and in many ways a national disgrace. Some people have resorted to 'gang banging'; to try and save a few dollars that will be later spent on unnecessary food and sanitary items. Some have even gone as far as to 'getting a job' as a last resort option. Tough, indefinitely. Easy, You donâ€™t believe this bullshit do you? no. So what can be done to help ease the pain and hopefully stop you from pulling the trigger?

As a child growing up in an one bedroom apartment, I've learnt that it's survival of the fittest if you're ever going to succeed in life. Which is why i sent off my baby brother for adoption and locked my two sisters into that tiny cupboard of mine. I felt as if they were dragging me down, and with three less mouths to feed i was sure to get my Christmas present early! You know, It really does feel liberating to have the whole house to yourself, despite the occasional kicking and screaming from inside the cupboard and the weekly visit from the child protection services. Ever since, my life has changed and mostly for the good, depending of course on how biased you are. No need for people to use the bathroom while i was in the shower, I mean, I could finally beat my mother in peace without having my siblings complain about 'Mummy's screaming'. I could finally think for myself.

I guess my point is that things can be done a lot better alone, especially without certain people worrying about why you forced them into the pantry as a small child or why you never tell your wife that she's pretty anymore (The natural process of aging). Got kids? Throw them in the trash and always remember to screw the lid on tight. That way, they don't make as much noise, which means you can enjoy your own home in a solitary state of silence ;) After all, they're used to eating the garbage at McDonalds, which means they'll last a while eating off all those scraps, even the plastics..........

Married? Pretend to "Come out of the closet". It worked for me, despite that fact that my partner was also a guy (Note: A am still an "Untamed" Heterosexual). Otherwise, a gun and a body bag can equally come in handy. Perhaps your mother is still leeching off your Centrelink income? Don't worry; just do what you originally planned to do. Which was to send her on a one way trip to Mexico. Although disguised as a 'holiday", she'll be absolutely devastated to find out that she's stuck in such a shit hole country, before realising that she did the exact same thing to her own mother.

All alone, your life will slowly degrade into that of 'a desperate uni student' (On cocaine of course). People will start hating you, you're ex-partner will start demanding more child care money from you and your prostitution dollars simply won't hold up. In many ways, isolating yourself from your loved ones, was not a very good idea, if not the worst decision of your life. Oh, and NOW you can pull the trigger.........
