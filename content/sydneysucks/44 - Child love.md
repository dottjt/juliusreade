Let's face it. Your once loving child has now grown up into the unlovable son-of-bitch you'd never thought he would be. You constantly cherish that spoilt brat with candy and materialistic means, yet they love your money more than they do you. For years, you've been comtemplating on the thought of suicicde, yet you can't even afford to buy a proper cutting knife. Your life sure is miserable, but don't fear! 

They use you for your money, as you eat shit and canned food for breakfast. Sure, you're life may be a mess but it's nothing compared to what it could've been if you had children.
