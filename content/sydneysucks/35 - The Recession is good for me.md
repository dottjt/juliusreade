The one reason why i think the recession will be good for my life will be a change of "Choice". For years i've been burdened by choice in too many aspects, but now with the recession i'll be able to enjoy less of a choice in life. Actually, it mainly relates to the videogame industry. In the perfect senario, Xbox will just fuck off back to whereever and allow the playstation brand to take over.
