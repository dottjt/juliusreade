I'm not a fraud. I'm not certainly not seedy. I've never touched a girl without the permission of her parents. Nor have i ever forced a girl's parents to sign a contract allowing me to sleep with their daughter, or son, if I'm feeling desperate. 'Help' is often a word associated with what i do in my spare time, even during my daily sessions of beating my sister up, and telling her that if she ever interupts me during my "private time infront of the computer, when the parent's aren't home" again, I'm going to have to fuck over her entire lesbian porn collection, and replace it with several videos of me, doing it with amputee victims and novelty animals, at the scene of a car crash as a man with glass sticking from his eye stumbles out of his car, throwing up blood on my ##$%!$.................However, I can Help, but not if you don't tell me. Which is why I'm going to show you how to, whether you like it or not............

As a child, no one ever helped me. No parent to tuck me into bed, No father to teach me how to steal lollies from the milk bar, and no Mother to teach me, or at least tell me that breast feeding at the age of 15 is weird and NOT highly fashionable, as i learnt yesterday, on public transport. With all these problems, came my will to learn from my own actions and thoughts. I had to learn the hard way, that tripping over an elderly lady onto a main road is illegal, although sorta funny, until she gets hit by the car. But also that woman don't like you touching them up in public, not to mention that when you're in bed and they to you to 'stop doing it', you should really stop or they'll tell the police the next morning. With all these factors acting as a disadvantage in life, I suffered. However, I'm going to teach you otherwise..................

So let's take Tim, aged 'fuck all', for example. He has no friends. He's been raped by his parents several times, in fact he's being raped right now as we speak. Mainly because It's me raping him. I mean, i know he's inflatable, but it doesn't mean that he's entirely useless.......However, based on these facts, Tim is the perfect representation of YOU. A loser. So how do we change 'Tim' around from being an inflatable loser, to being an non-inflatable, but respectable person. A person that does NOT take drugs, while NOT being a complete dick and sleeping with his best friend's sister..........

First things first, I want you to put down the 'Ice-pipe'/'Bong' that you're currently sharing with your group of high friends, and take a walk outside (Or in your case, stumble towards the door, while not trying to knock over the 'ceiling high' pile of hash, saved up for the winter months). What do you see? Now i know it's a very stupid question, since you're probably outside and not reading this. Let alone the fact that you and you're stoned friends are reading this article while getting smashed, just as 'Billy' passes out from all the smoke in the room......................visiblity is down to the nearest metre.

So what did you see? A dead hooker laid on your footpath, gasping for 'air', when she really meant to say 'Herowin'? Or did you see a 'Red Guard' force a line of Tibetan people into a 'Secret PLA booth', embracing the 'Mao Tattoo' on all their foreheads? No matter what you saw, it probably wasn't real, and just a nasty side affect from all the drugs you're doing. Taking several LSD's before going to bed, for every night since you were 10 years old will do that to you. Unless if you're Ashane, from which that's an UNDERSTATEMENT. (.....damn, i just couldn't help myself. I think I'm going to have to change this 'statement' in the near future)

Now i know that you're miserable inside, but don't worry, because you have no future (much like for Dr. Nelson's career. [Oh Snap!!!] {I think there's my political quota filled for today}), so why bother with trying to improve your life, when you potentially could be taking more illicit drugs ? I know it probably won't make things better, but it's OK. You can just over come your fears with even more drugs and alcohol, which can only be A GOOD THING................allegedly*.

Damn it, i really wanted to do a Sam refference, seeing as how this article has to do with drugs and Sams a bit stoned, but I held myself back, and manged: 0 Sam refferences. (Excludes this section, because it's not apart of the official article, it's sort of like 'a Julius' insight of things'."
