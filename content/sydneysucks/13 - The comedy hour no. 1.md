The Comedy Hour #1 

Finally, I'm uploading the Comedy Hour recording. Now there's actually a recording of the show on the 774 abc site, however you can't download it, and its only the first half. (It doesn't have the wierd second half, that's some really weird comedy sketch "The Sunday format?" Still good none-the-less.)

The Comedy Hour #1 - 5500 KB

PS: The first 10 Minutes are missing, and there might be some 'door closing' and some unnoticed noises, but it doesn't really interfere with the playback. The next recording will be better, cause this one was out of short notice.

PS Update: I've removed the download link, perhaps because of suscpicsion from the Australian Broadcasting Commission...........
