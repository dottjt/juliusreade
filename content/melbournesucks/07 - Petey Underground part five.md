Petey bared a similar resemblance to his parents whom once loved him. Day and night, Petey would dream that one day his parents would visit him for a short, distasteful discussion about death and the amputation of his closest ones. Especially during his sleep, false dreams involving his parents were common, but somehow 'rewarding' in Petey's opinion. His dreams made him mentally stronger and in some cases, revived his thirst for blood and the thought that he too would fulfill his life-long dream that was encased by his humble disability..............the chance to be normal.

But none a moment too soon, he quietly woke up inside the room of what only could be described as a hospital ward. Not only did this cheer Petey up from his sorrows, but engulfed him in the fantastic thought that he too, was surrounded by the disabled and sick, much like himself. Petey based his life on the poor, sick and mentally ill in ways that made the sensible human 'afraid'. He lurked around the room, comparing between who looked more sick and amputated. It soon became a game of the mind, deciding who would die first, among the many sick within the ward. Soon it became too exciting for Petey till the point where he couldn't get to sleep. Petey knew he needed help.

People thought Petey was crazy, but his obsession for death was what separated himself from others. Speculation of an 'accidental' death for Petey was considered by administration. But death wasn't an option for Petey. Not until he had achieved his life-long goal to become his former self........................
