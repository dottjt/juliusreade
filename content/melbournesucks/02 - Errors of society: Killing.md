Many light-hearted people may suggest that killing is a good thing, but yet we tend to avoid killing as a sign of respect towards elders and the mentally challenged. But how effective is 'killing' in a modern day society where people are constantly getting killed in video games and in carparks around the world? Killing is often percepted as a weak excuse for population control or quarantine, but there are some benefits in killing off a population and it's collective group of religious people. Mainly, it will reduce the number of 'unwanted people', etc. Politicians, Doctors, to a sustainable value of zero, which will mostly increase happiness and tourism within a majority of areas worldwide. But who is considered useless among the upper classes of people, (me)?

Doctors - Doctors at first many seem like a valuable resource, but as i say, 'If it ain't broken, then shut up'. Cause through years of dedicated research and gaming, I've learnt that it's better to leave a sick person dead than to help him. Reason being that the person shouldn't have gotten sick in the first place, like EVERY OTHER FRICKN' NORMAL PERSON!!!!!!!!!! Also relating back to an overall healthier and 'elite' population.

The Elderly - I'm sick of old people telling me to get off their lawn which is why they all should die. But thankfully much like every other religion, their going to die off anyway........

Anime fans? - It has been proven that 100% of the time, anime fans have been the cause for such paths as Islam and Diabetes. Kill them all, i'll supply the guns and probably already have.......

Many people are almost certainly saying (or thinking), 'Is that all you've got? Thats a crap list and it's not even funny', from which i think/say back 'You know what, i agree with you but plz do realize that i haven't written anything in a long time' From which you'll say...........
