Although nobody is reading this, I'd like to think that i have a well respected audience of teenagers and brutes, vigorously gathering notes and further discussing the future and present of this blog. But why do i have this blog? Well as far as 'Learning by doing' goes, my articles are in other words, 'practice' on my charming, but yet unclaimed ability to write. And Although that ability is at the current status of "weak". I shall courageously build up my skill to create articles and contribute to companies such as Sony and that rich one......or maybe not. So why the unhappy face Julius? Did somebody touch you in ways of sickness again? You neighbour did what!!!!! Well i must say that was rather naughty of him, (she laughs charmingly). But I'll be damned if the police don't know.....but what? That old man says he'll 'do it again' if the police have knowledge? Well best we keep that knowledge concealed young man, and not have anybody know about it. Very well, Ta ta (Bye). I shall see your smile just the way it was next time we meet.........Bye for now....... (The polite lady walks off and a dark man, concealed by shadows, jumps from the bushes and grabs the young boy, hastily beginning his ritual)......
