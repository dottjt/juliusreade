Whenever i see a picture of the Olsen Twins or perhaps a photograph of my mutated sister, i usually react unaccordingly and throw up all over the sofa, from which i hope it will just clean up all by it's self. Sometimes, this may result to taking unwise and life-threatening measures. Occasionally, you might be walking down the street, up until a homeless bum threatens you with a knife. How shall one respond? I don't talk from experience, but if it were to happen i would kindly hand over all my precious belonging, including my surrounding relatives. Why? Because of common sense, and i shall teach you all about it......in the next paragraph.

When i wake up, i don't just get up from a good nights sleep and get over it. I let people know about my experiences and how good it felt to be dreaming about my imaginary, but hot girlfriend. People say I'm wierd, but who's the fool when your friends and family aren't expressing their experiences on the internet or w/e. At 9am, i get in my car and drive over other people's lawn just to let them know that i had a great dream last night. Even if i didn't have a good dream, i still drive all over they're lawn and sometimes their pets, only because of common sense. Now i bet your asking, "What if i can't drive you fool?". Never you mind what you can and can't do, just convince your parents it's for 'research puposes' and give it a go. As they say.........'if you can't drive, it won't hurt tyring!!!' (PS: not an actual quote. I hate anime.)

Through out the years, common sense has taught me many things including the ability to 'speed read' however,
