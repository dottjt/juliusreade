Don't know why i wrote this........

It's quite tough in a democratic world to try and abandon your love ones without having the finger pointed at you in the most responsible of manners. Fools alike would only have the willpower to criticize and discover the true potential of living a free but lonesome life, one that i have lived. So come fourth and i shall teach you the many ways of the potential wise man, one whom lives a life of fear and regret. Even now, i coil into a ball and lay dead silent, waiting for the creatures of the night to attack my soul and tear apart my hopes and dreams into the endless depths of hell..........

The light beneath me is intriguing and guides me through a life of freedom and squire. Surrounded by the happiness of others, the sun from millions of miles away, blinds my eyes and glitters the words of cheerfully spirits, spiraling out of control into the pleasant sound of glory. Outside is filled with hope and pageant esteem of the white knights decent. Even our leader of the Garnonians shall bring fourth our jovial minds of and bring together the meaningful crushes of aspiration.

Laughing at the Ex-wife of Troy i continue to strive for excellence in a school that has taught so much wrong. Ever since the unbearable nights of Dark crusades, my mind has been play against it's contrary, teaching itself to evolve into much more than one could hope, hibernating until the time has come to break free, and astound the working man.

It was only a matter of time until the seal was to be broken. Only in dreams did the people wish that country men fight back the evil forces of the south and defend the home capital of the north. Previously there had not been much anticipation to the rival opening 'of castle 17', but there was no choice. The people needed to survive and fight back against the overgrowing evil.
