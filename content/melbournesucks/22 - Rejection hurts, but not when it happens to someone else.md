I warned her about the risks and dangers of drinking the contaminated water by the river, but she always insisted to consume it. I never understood why she drank the water, considering that she had already a perfectly clean water supply from the house she lived in, (beside the river). Every morning i would wake up, and outside would be that young lady, drinking the black sludge from within the river. As years passed by, the river became more and more polluted. So much so, that all the fish had died and many of the riverside residence had moved on to cleaner areas of the basin. But that didn't stop the young lady from drinking the wastely hazard. In fact, as the pollution increased, it seemed that she began drinking the water more frequently. Quite often, it was a common sight to catch the young lady by the river, hastily consuming the bio-hazardous material by the hand fulls....or at least as much as she could.

Then one day i got very curious, and decided to question the woman about her practices. I quietly arrived at her house and knocked on the door, but no answer. After waiting and repeatedly knocking for a while, I got very curious because she's either found inside her home or beside the lake drinking. I thought perhaps she could be sleeping, but then again, she never turns her lights off at night. So, quietly walking in i screamed in shock and wonder. For dead on the floor; was the young lady with putrile, black liquid pouring and trothing from her mouth.

I wanted to run away in fear, but felt compelled to stay and 'investigate' the situation. Slowly, i placed my arm over her throat in search for a pulse. She was most certainly dead and i smirked for it. I attempted to clean the body and then picked it up. Took it home and haven't returned it since. I knew i had done the right thing by me. After all, i was the one responsible for releasing the highly addictive toxins into the river. I mean, to be rejected by a girl is one thing, but to have your revenge is a whole different feeling.................

"For those who didn't quite get the story (Despite the fact i have no readers), basicly the woman had rejected the man in the past and hes stalking her. He decides to put a substance in the lake that gets more and more addicting depending on the quantity you drink. Now the man had set it up so that the woman would get addicted to the substance and eventually die so that the man could eventually "have his way" with the corpse............ (or perhaps just the feeling of revenge.)"
