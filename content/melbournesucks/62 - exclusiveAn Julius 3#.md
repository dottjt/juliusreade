Finally after a period of about 3 weeks, exams are over, studying has become a thing of the past, but more importantly................I can begin writing daily 'segments' for this blog. Why? Well sometimes playing videogames can even be a little too much for me, which is why i divert all my attention to this blog and wish that all my friends will just fk off and leave me alone. (From which you say: "What friends?" and then everybody laughs, leaving me in a state of unhappiness and embarrassment)..................

I've also decided to start many new 'segments' (Part 1, 2, 3 etc.), mainly to try and broaden my 'material' (Jokes etc.). Hopefully, i'll also improve my ablity to write, although i really should be spending this quality time to try and learn chinese vocabulary and the subject in general.

So, happily typing away on some crap about taking drugs and wearing pants, a bear attacks me!!!!! I jump from the chair, through the window, out the gate, down the street, safely hiding in the bushes...............but before any of that happens, the bear rips me apart with its teeth and licks my insides through the pores in my skin...............
