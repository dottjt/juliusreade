Sometimes in life, we must create priorities, and playing Team Fortress 2 is one of mine. It's probably the best Online Multiplayer game I've played since Rise of Nations, and is one of those games that will take a LONG time to get bored of. But in addition, I've also downloaded Counter-Strike: Source (Off Steam you fools), and i must say that it's a great game, especially since I sorta suck at "Cs 1.6". So as my life continues, and i play more and more games, I leave behind certain tasks, such as writing for this blog and perhaps beating up my little sister..........(Although for some reason, she doesn't exist, which says a lot about my sanity).

Just remember one thing, that If you are reading this, then please stop trying to plagiarise me, even if you love me, or hate me, because I KNOW, who you are.........
