People in general are threatened by the possibilities of a totalitarian state, but I'd rather worry about the kind of ruthless people who watch anime. To recap, it is quite clear that anime has been used as a fascist regime in recent attempt to try and brainwash the innocent and clear minds of young school girls, further trapped in a world filled with bright lights and pictures, to give off evil and pornogrphic messages. Not to worry though, as i, the smart and responsible person of the group, has come up with yet another guide to help protect your moral rights and authority, so that you, the average citizen, can live a happy and wasted life as an employee at McDonald's.

So what kind of a threat does watching anime pose to our 'anime watching' population? It's fairly simple, they watch anime and are therefore hated within the greater community (Me). Now many of you are probably thinking, "WTF, u suck Julius, i like watching anime because it's enjoyable". From which i tell you to shut up and sit down, because as we all know, anime is just crap and isn't enjoyable to watch. It's sort of like death. We don't want it to happen, but yet it still does when we least expect it.

I bet your also telling yourself, "After all this reading you still haven't told me about anything to do with protecting myself against anime, let alone fighting back at anime". Well what exactly can we do protect ourselves from anime? In fact why don't we just avoid people who watch anime? Wouldn't that be the responsible thing to do? Absolutely not, as we must not let these arsonists get away with what they have done. So next time you meet anyone whom is related to watching anime, spill their drink over or call them a racist slur, for you are partialy sure to be respected within the community as a true hero and possibly an unique individual. Allegedly, i enjoy going into book stores that sell anime and set the whole section on fire with my Molotov cocktail and a few cans of petrol. Not only will it fill the air with the precious smell of gasoline, but will also deter the greater community to read any anime-based material, which promotes growth and a good example for the kiddies.

Infact, here's a list of possible things to do to children influenced by anime:

- Tell them that their parents don't love them.
- Grab the anime comic their holding and run off it.
- Tell them the truth about anime, then order them to give you $50. (doesn't always work....)
- Tell them that they can't have kids. (Infertile)
- Push them on the ground and steal their wallet.
- Put them in a dark room and try and steal their credit card number.
- Pretend to be their best friend, then tell them that you were just joking. (They've never ever had friends, so it'll be funny to see their reaction afterwards)
- Convince them that they sell anime at Club X, then tell their parents and get them in trouble.

Now i bet your most likely saying to yourself, "I hate you Julius, this is a waste of time, i never should have read this crap". From which i say too bad, because this is the end of yet another useful chapter in my failed quest to eliminate anime by the year 2020 and etc.
