Continuing my research outside of the Mental asylum, i had a good look at what was happening to the patients in the courtyard. Victims of anime were being severely beaten with electric batons and mentally brokendown with taunts and gestures. The undernourished were being gassed with liquid nitrogen, before being thrown onto a giant meat mincer that would instantly convert the corpses into 'A grade' dog food. Even the children were suffering, as the guards threw some more anime DVDs onto the fire pit, tormenting the children with scars they'll never forget. As disgraceful as it was, i continued to watch as a pair of inmates 'faked sex' in front of a guard to try and 'meet his requirements and wants'.

Despite the danger and risk, i walked up to the electric fence and tried to get some of the opinions of the victims within. Tim of 14 replied: "When a guard asks me to have sex with another inmate, i don't fake it, i have a good time while 'fulfilling my duties', if you know what i mean." Immediately after his response, a guard gunned him down with a sniper and then immediatly threw his corpse into the meat mincer. I was horrified at how ruthless the guard was, but smiled a little inside knowing that i was going to make millions of dollars off this documentary. I later decided to get the opinion of the person behind the treatment of these 'prisoners'.

As i entered the building, pictures of anti-anime slogans and logos were posted on every inch of the wall, including the ceiling. But before i could get anywhere near the front desk, a pair of guards started beating me with their batons, until 10-minutes later, realised that i wasn't a victim of anime, and in fact just a normal person. Anyhow, they told me to leave or they would start calling me names, like 'wanker' or 'bum-face'. Under immense pressure, i decided to leave and fake my interview with the owner of the asylum:

Me: Hi, and thank you for taking this interview.
Him: No probs, at least I'm not gay like you........
Me: umm.....cool. So why do you treat these people the way you do?
Him: Who?
Me: You know, the victims that you beat up and kill....
Him: Oh them? I think you've got it completely messed up, THEY'RE the evil ones. They constantly beat up my guards and hurt our staff. We would never think about hurting them. We're just here to try and help, but they keep disrupting our fine work.
Me: What the hell are you talking about!?!?? I saw your guards throw corpses into a giant meat-mincer and yet you call it 'fine work'.............
Him: Are you questioning my authority? You realise i can just have you killed right now!! Besides, they watch anime. They deserve it.
Me: Hmmm.........True. I can't argue with that. Thanks for your time. Say, whats your name?
Him: ...............
Me: Never mind then. I'll just being leaving now.
Him: ...............
Me: (This is awkward)

As i quietly walked out of the interview room, i looked behind me to find 'that man' staring back at me, as if he were a little child watching his parents fight, from his bedroom door............
