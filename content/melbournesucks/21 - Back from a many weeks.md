Only recently, had i 'reformed' and rediscovered my true, happy, but normal self. Tired and depraved from my past weeks of intense Smash Bros, Zelda and NDS group gatherings, had a discovered and embellished something much more wise and beneficial than the 5 hours of videogames being played everyday. So, as an underpaid, mislead, mistreated, abused, confused and morally-weakened human being, i decided to pickup the long-awaited needle, dangerously filled with noxious heroin and jab it into the remaining 'skin and bone' of my arm. Tightly constricted, of course. You know, there's nothing worse than a good hit of precious heroin going to waste, and away from the blood stream...?

In addition, we mustn't forget the hardworking and privileged families, whom choose to create my 'product' of choice. Absolutely nothing but good word and positive feedback have come from their customers, including my dear-self. Never you mind what the police say, their all just a bunch of big bullies. Merrily taking away our common rights to make way for their foreign policies and harmful gestures. It's complete madness i tell'ya. But i have a Little something that will get them off their asses and back on the street working harder than ever, thanks to a secret formula i discovered while 'pleasing' the wife......

It's basically a combination of deadly poisons and some 'hidden' condiments, found from various locations within my local KFC. I tried it on my brother and it looked like it worked a treat. I mean, i haven't tried it myself, but boy did he look like he was having a good time. He hasn't called me since, but I'm sure it's not related to the incident.....
