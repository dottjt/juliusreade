Rapists. Christians. Stalkers. Pedophiles. They all have something in common, that is they're all mostly evil (With the exception of Stalkers and Pedophiles. Perhaps Rapists). What drives they're will to do 'such things' is yet unknown, but yet widely recognised within the community. If i were to ask a 5 year old about 'certain people', he/she would happily answer with the correct response."Yes, he is one of the many men currently stalking me" or "I think i remember seeing him in my bedroom one day, at night". Even if we were to expose their 'hidden secrets' and beyond, we would find a shocking trend, eventually leading to suicide, immense depression, not to mention the excess Yu-Gi-Oh playing.

By no means do i discourage the practice of Yu-Gi-Oh and other incredibly crap card games, (Except PKM TCG, to a certain extent) however, i do advise that Yu-Gi-Oh be banned as 'a whole', thus destroying the entire band of criminals, thief's, and other evil forces, currently slaving away at what they do best, corrupting society. Now i know i can't back this massive claim with hard evidence, but let us answer a simple question first: Do 'you' want to corrupt society?

At the scene of nearly every robbery, it would quite clear and allegedly evident to find the criminal stealing a deck of Yu-Gi-Oh cards, before escaping the premises. Although all relevant evidence has been erased by the evil doers themselves, it would be quite fair to point out that Yu-Gi-Oh is a crap card game, that has unconditionally ended the life's of many people, through unthinkable methods of suicide, as well as cleaner methods of extermination on innocent civilians..........

The symbol of Yu-Gi-Oh has been expressed in many ways, from setting our best friend on fire, to watching 'excess' amounts of anime. No matter what your reason, I'm sure i could come up with at least a millions instances', where Yu-Gi-Oh has ruined our lives:

Sacha, 10: "Yu-Gi-Oh has taught me that killing and hurting little kids is a good thing."

Sarah, 9: "When i wake up each day, i cut my wrists and drink that blood that comes out :) ."

Tim, 11: "hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah.......... I'll KILL YOU!!!"

Peter, 7: "Yu-Gi-Oh is like a drug, i can't stop smoking it.............."

Julius, 15: "I haven't actually been affected, so i don't know why my quote is here......"

So as we can see, Yu-Gi-Oh has clearly affected the minds of 5 children (Except me), in ways that will eventually lead them to future professions, such as: Rapist, Stalker, Priest and Drug Dealer. Hopefully in the near future, us humans will further learn about how Yu-Gi-Oh affects our minds, whether we like it or not....................(In other words, don't do drugs!!!..........and stuff?)
