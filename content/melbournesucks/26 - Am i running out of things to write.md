Am i really running out of things to write, cause I'm screwed then. This blog depends on an author and without one.................well nothing much would happen. But on the other hand, it's people like me whom restore balance into this injust world and help the desperate (you), into thinking you're important in a society where people gather around firepits and sing ridiculous songs like: "That christmas song" and "Where am i?".
