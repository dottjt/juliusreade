'Laughing' has been described by many as 'entertaining' and 'positive', as opposed to crying or being stabbed by your mother, with a bread-knife. It also has properties that often set it apart from other emotions, such as the fact it doesn't require the movement of your arms or the fact that you actually don't have to be amused. In other words, Laughing can be faked just to make your best friends seem funny. But why should we fake it? Isn't it wrong and shouldn't we just be honest?

Morally, faking a laugh isn't wrong, as compared to murdering your little sister or watching anime. So how do we do it? There are many ways one might chose fake a laugh, however, i shall be teaching you the most difficult and least promising method: Laughing normally. Much like the original method, you basically just laugh without the 'added emotion'. However, there are some simple measures you can take to make your laugh seem more authentic. Assuming that the your friend is an idiot, start by telling the opposing person that he's not funny and that he just sucks. Then immediately afterwards, Dack his/her pants and run away while screaming: "I have no pants on".

In no way will this method work, but in 'other' ways, might boost you self esteem to perform brave/idiotic tasks, as previously displayed. I really should be writing about how to fake a laugh, but I've now reallied how stupid this topic is, as is all my topics and how hard it is to write anything relating to it. Maybe i should just stop writing, then i won't be able to finish this article and all this hard work will just go to waste. Oh well............Wait!!! I know!!! What if i just type the name of the girl whom i have a secret crush of.........? Then again, i guess it won't be a secret crush then. Nvm, i guess this just isn't the time nor place to be talking about such issues. I'm now dead. Good Bye.
