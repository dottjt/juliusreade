When a man/woman falls down a continuous escalator, vigourously scraping away all signs of beautifulness, leaving fragments of skin, bone and hair, fused together from the pressure the sharp edges of the escalator ramp, on the end of their face......................we then:

A/ Point and laugh, while they scream intensively to try and endure the pain of having their face shredded by the iron ramps, leaving nothing but a trail of blood, brain; including their ability to walk ever again.

B/ Get your friend to distract the 'person', while you try and steal their credit card.

C/ Super Glue their hands to the floor. 

D/ All of the above

Now although all these options seem 'unrealistic' and 'immoral', what else is one to do when in such a situation? I wouldn't actually know, however maybe i could write some sort of guide to help 'you' to become a better person, in terms of general behaviour and possible sexiness.......... Useless if you're into the same sex, then i don't think you should reading this article, let alone this blog. (Girls Excepted)

Personally, i would try to help the 'stupid-idiot', instead of the extremely hot chick, that needs someone to help her carry all her new, expensive clothes to her personal Limo. Now we all know that i like hot girls, (escpecially the lesbians reading this, as displayed from youporn.com) but sometimes we must make personal/regretful sacrifices in order to succeed in life, and this is one of them. So How do we help these people? Do we just stare at them and give them mental support? Or do we physically put in the effort to pick up this 'certain person' off the ground, before pushing them back down the stairs again?

It really does depend on what mood your in. Often when I'm happy, i'll ignore the injured person and continue my daily shopping, consisting of stealing 'priced' goods from the Video Game store. However, when I'm in an angry mood, i'll again, avoid the person in need, and continue to allegedly steal valuable goods from my nearest Kmart or Target. In fact, no matter what my mood, I can reassure you that i won't attempt to help anybody, escpecially the ones in need.

I know think you'll think I'm arrogant for saying that, but please do realise that i have more important things to do and care much more for myself than some 'idiot' who has got his/her toungue stuck inside the ATM slot. I know it's just a bit mean, but i can't be all a bad thing? Sometimes, it's good to be mean to your elders and etc. but yet i don't know why. To find out why, the Melbournesucks team, consisting of me, decided to ask respected Scientist Tim Regan for some answers:

Me: Thanks for your time Tim, and so what should we do to help others?
Tim: ...............
Me: Tim, are you alright.....?
Tim: ...............
Me: I SAID, ARE YOU ALRIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!
Mother: Julius, who are you talking to.......I heard you scream?
Me: (Oh shit), Uh, um, no-one mum, just talking to myself.
Mother: Yeh bulls*it, thats what you said last time, but you were really spanking your..........I'm going in there.
Me: (F*ck, where am i going to hide my cocaine stache.....), Tim fking hide before i get caught...
Mother: (Enters room),......Wait a sec what the fuck is that man doing in here. You little shit, what did i tell you about letting strangers into my fking house. What the Hell? What's that white powder on your nose......It's not....no, you bastard I'm going to kick your ass!!!!!!!!
Me: No mum!!!! Stop beating me, it hurts!! Arghh, fk.!@#$ Please put down the iron rod!!~~ (I begin to cry while my mother beats me).
Mum: Argghhh!!~ TAKE THAT you no good son-of-a-bit*h!!!!! (Mother picks up my desk chair, and smacks it accross the back of my head).
Tim: ...............

And so from my mistakes, hopefully we as a society can learn more about each other through violence, happiness and beatings. Otherwise, I'm just an idiot........
