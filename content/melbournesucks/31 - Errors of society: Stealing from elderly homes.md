If you live near a housing centre for the elderly or often visit an elderly relative at an old people's home, it is a regular sight to see me stealing their pension numbers in my pathetic effort to try and become rich, but respected amidst our young faithful brothers, slaving away at Surrey Hills Anglican Church. Together, we unite to become one and eventually......blah blah blah. But no matter what your reason to steal other people's belongings, remember that there really is only one place to steal, and that is at: The old people's retirement homes. Where else are you going to find quality medical supplies to help your friends get high at the next house party, or that portable TV you wanted for the next road trip? At one place and that's at you local retirement home and here are the reasons why:

It's less suspicious: When i go into a retirement home, the surrounding people's reaction is: "That young sexy, charming, hot young man is here to visit that bitch of a relative. Damn it, i should be the one feeling up that boy!!!!". However, when i enter a hardware store or my local shopping centre the reaction is: "That ugly son-of-a-bitch!!! I don't know who the hell he is but i reckon he's going to steal something, I'd better call the police". It's not that the elderly are stupid, it's just that the elderly think differently to the younger generation (Basically their just stupid).

Who's going to catch you?: Assuming you get caught by the old guy sipping his soup, there are only two possible people that could possibly stop you. The dude in the electric wheelchair and the chick behind the counter from whom you had previous 'said hello to' (Had sex with) and has decided to let you go. Everybody else are either old or......old? Besides, the worst trouble you could get in, would be a feeble spanking from one of the elderly women (Especially nice if your into elder women and that kind of stuff ;)

It's easier to plan: The logic is quite simple. You walk into the building requesting for community service and 'Pronto Baby!!' you're guaranteed the opportunity to steal anything. (And perhaps if your lucky, the heart of one of one of the many fine old ladies :) (Loving making is not advised, as older women are USUALLY physically and mentally LESS attractive than lets say........me?

More opportunity: Mistakes can and usually do happen during burgualries etc. 'accidentally leave your hideout address at the counter' or 'For some reason told the manager your home phone, work and mobile number', but thanks to the less-than-generous people at Glen Waverly retirement home, there is no risk!!!! When i steal something at my RSL, I take twice as much than i should, because i know that there are NO qualified people looking over me. Plus, you gain that extra bit of satisfaction that personally says: 'Take that old people, i just stole your TV and your all going to suffer a life of misery and hell'. Let alone the fact that you now have an extra TV around the house.

So there you have it again folks, a quality, misread, misinterpreted article that will continue to puzzle people for years.........
