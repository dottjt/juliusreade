"Whats that hidden there, among the clouds.............."

"It's over now. You can wake up......". I felt compelled to move, but didn't have the energy. Not only was i weak from the recent disturbances, but i had broken my arm from falling down a set of stairs, after eagerly fleeing from a foot soldier terrorising the village. I got up from my knees and felt the walls for the light switch in the pitch dark. I hadn't seen any light in days, slowly opening the trap door from above me. My eyes were immediately blinded and pierced in unrecovered pain admist the sunlight, appearing from through the shattered window. I tried not to show any signs of pain or weakness among the other survivors, unbearably trying to hide my immediate restrain from all the outside light. Arguably though, there weren't as many survivors as i had expected, to experience the hurt in my eyes.

Our district leader advised the remainding 'Outcasts', into groups to further search into the village for other survivors. I must admit, that i never really enjoyed forming search parties, in fact i'd rather be trapped than to search. Not only would it take days, but i guess i'm just a lazy person. I guess it's just a fact of life in todays society. Your either a searcher or possibly dead.

Me and my mate Bill, checked under the rubble of the old town library that i never really was fond of. Each Sunday, I'd used to hang out with friends and hassle the nerds with threats and orders, as they quitely entered and exitted the building. But that would be no more, with the current unraveling situation happening before us. Only the stong have survived and for generations, will continue to. Nowadays, it seems that it is I, who is recieving a majority of the hassling. Particularily from the elders.

Several hours later, our group had discovered a few people hiding beneath the library chambers. Although in bad physical condition, they were still able to survive the virus that had killed a large proportion of our elite population. My father was infected with the virus has died ever since. I don't know why, but something tells me that i might have the virus too.....................
