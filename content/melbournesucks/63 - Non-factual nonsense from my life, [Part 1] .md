Anyone who has been to my house would know that it's a natural disaster waiting to happen. There's thumbtacks randomly scatter on the floor, the deadly fumes from the crystal meth lab in the garage reeks through the steel mesh windows, intoxicating the innocent children next door. Sometimes I'll just leave the stove gas on, and re-enact WW2. But no matter what i do, i can't seem to clean up the damn place. Begging the question, 'Should i stop pouring milk into my bed, to try and keep out the ladies and etc.'?

As i walk towards the living room, I accidental step on my 'ice pipe', also hoping that my addiction for drugs would also 'break'. Shelf after shelf lay bottles of lotion, one marked 'amphetamine', others less legal. In the corner however, is the star attraction of the house, the one and only reason why anyone bothers to come to my house: The blow-up doll 'Dolly'. Using only the finest of rubber, me and my mates assembled this 'Bad Bitch' using only duck tape and our 'man-juice', as my mate Derick calls it. Night after night, she generates the sound of buzzing, while i scream in unholy pleasure. From the outside, you stare in wonder, but from the inside, you feel and see the pleasure.

I remember when i first used 'Dolly' as a child. I was young, ambiguous and haven't stop using her since. Why pay for sex i say, when you could have it plugged in and ready to go in the living room? Sometimes i look back at my life and realise what i regret it was. The fact that I'm too popular, drug abuse and my skill and talent, are all just a few too many things i wish i didn't have. But the one thing in life that i haven't regretted, is 'Dolly'. She been their for the bad times, and the good, In fact she's been their for me 'every night' for the past 15 years...................

However, one things for sure. She works a lot better than that corpse i keep in the bathroom..................
