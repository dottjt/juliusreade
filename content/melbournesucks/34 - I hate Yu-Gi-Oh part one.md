As a mature, 'better' professional, i realise greater threats and other preventatives in society, such as Warhammer and my PSP. However, there are just some things in society that shalln't go unnoticed such as the threat that is "Yu-Gi-Oh". Now don't get me wrong, i used to collect these cards as a child and perhaps traded them with friends, and although the heavenly soul within prevented my inner being from playing any actual duels, I look at how else i can criticize the 'necessary' components that form 'Yu-Gi-Oh'. But more importantly, what can the average human do from being sucked into the bloody bath hell that is the crappy card game, Yu-GAY-Oh? (Hahahahahahaha, get it? Gay-Oh!!! HAhahahaha.........nvm.)

As a feeble but strong willed person, you should already know that 'Yu-Gi-Oh' is the mere essence of ALL wrong-doings, which composes the evil forces of bad karma. The evil forces being Bad luck, Being unattractive, Having no 'real' friends, Eating from the bin and last but not least, Killing your relatives for 'Experience' (XP). Apart from these basic qualities, you should have also figured out that it is ACTUALLY 'Yu-Gi-Oh', and NOT "anime" that has sourced all this evil for many generations and years. This can be proven through wisdom, and this is what i am here to teach you.

Passed down from the generations, my Sensei taught me about the great qualities of being a man, however, we are not here to discuss this issue. So how has 'Yu-Gi-Oh' affected us? In every way possibly my dear friend, but lets start off with mishaps of life in general. Whenever you stub your toe, or stab your eye with a utility compass, you think to yourself, 'F**k, that hurt, but why me?'. Most likely because you're a complete idiot to stab yourself in the eye in the first place, but 'Yu-Gi-Oh' has recently played a larger part in conducting your stupid actions (Very stupid indeed). Throughout the universe, 'dark matter' travels at blinding speed from which they eventually arrive to Earth. Yu-Gi-Oh cards have been scientifically proven to gather this 'Dark Matter' and exploit it in such ways that influence 'Bad Karma'. Now i know it sound a bit tacky, but just hang in for a bit longer........

Well basically, Dark Matter = Bad = Yu-Gi-Oh cards??????

(5 minutes later, when you finally understand the concept of dark matter relating to Yu-Gi-Oh cards..............)

"(scream, scream)!!!!....Oh no Julius, I'm really scared of this 'dark matter' threat. How do we defend ourselves from it?" The solution is rather simple. As a dedicated 'professional' i find that a deck of 'Pokemon Cards' is quite useful in terms of trying to defeat the evils of 'Dark Matter'. However, i also find them quite useful in terms collecting and trading. Even if you aren't under the threat of Yu-Gi-Oh (Although highly unlikely), go now and buy a deck of Pokemon cards. Not only will you be protected from evil, but you can also duel your friends with them or trade that rare, shiny Charizard for a fake 'Muk'.............(Not suggested)
