As a conservative young liberal hosting brave but necessary debate on issues that the Greens haven't been keen enough to answer, do i put forward a proposal that shall entice the wider audience (me) and grab their immediate and uttermost attention. Not only are the Labour party cheap and dirty, but have also been attempting to put an end to the many years of prosperity and hope of John Howard's excellent leadership and control. I myself, a part of my local Liberal branch, ARE and AM disgusted by the Labour party and their hopeless plead to try and buy peoples votes, while trying to lead a country. But as pathetic as it is, it hasn't always been politics that have ruined Labours minimal reputation amongst people.

Everyday when i wake up, i cry in front of the bathroom mirror knowing that The Labour party is in control of this fine nation. However, aside from cutting my wrists, I've found other ways to express my important, but disregarded opinions. When i arrive back home from school each day, i make my opinion count by throwing a Molotov cocktail, through the window of my local council. Not only does it get the message across by telling politicians 'i hate them', it also guarantees that less money is being spent on schools and social security, and instead on fixing up the office each week. Not to mention that it's a great way to release all that frustration from life's troubles; such as being bullyed and intimidated by your rivals.

Sometimes people are often cheap and won't go to expense of buying a six pack of beer and a lighter, which is why there are even cheaper ways to express your opinion. Now I'm no expert, but a fist to the face 'more often than not' works a treat when convincing your rival. The last time i saw Kevin Rudd, i left a black ring on his eye (allegedly), reminiscing the fact that he is EVIL. The police however, disagreed and lockup me up, but at least the main focus and attention in the media was based on your message. Or at least we hope so...............
