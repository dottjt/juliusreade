A large majority of the sane working population would agree that drugs in general can be a deterrent, and possibly 'addictive' in some cases. They claim that illegal drugs are some how bad, and not good. Some people would even say that drugs can destroy lives and force people into an endless world of misery and despair. But that is simply not true. Drugs are what you would call, 'a sometimes food'. It doesn't have to be dangerous, but yet so many idiotic fools choose to take this 'some-how' evil placebo incorrectly, but further more, dangerously.

Take this imaginary person 'Bob', for example. He's been smoking pot for years and yet he still achieves an A+ every time he takes his exams. Now despite the fact that he's 35 and has repeated the 5th grade over 15 times, my main point is that he can still be functional in society, while taking illicit drugs. Even as we speak, bob is most likely sucking on his bong, happily integrating with the Australian persona and life. Now apart from the fact that Bob is only imaginary and that what he is doing is possibly 'illegal', he is indeed LUCKY and FORTUNATE to have ended up where is today (Repeating 5th grade).

As a child, i grew up with drug dealers and rapists (not to mention some Christians), which means I've learnt from the 'best of the best' in the industry, when it comes to all your corrupt needs. The single most important thing i had allegedly learnt about taking drugs, is that you can still take them and have fun, while not actually getting caught. This in some ways is a GOOD thing, as it can develop your stealth skills that can be later applied in some way or another (eg. stealing). This may include changing your name or perhaps disguising your drugs to resemble something else, (eg. a handbag). However you choose to do it, please remember that no matter how hard you try, you are most likely going to get caught. Escpecially when you change your name to 'Drug lord 3000' or when people notice a 'needle' poking out the end of your wallet.

Aside from those reasons, you should have no excuse for doing drugs, unless if your parents force you or if you just suck at SSBB. Anyways. 'SO WHAT' if drugs destroy lives, if you've bothered reading up to here, you've most likely already destroyed yours........a long time ago.
