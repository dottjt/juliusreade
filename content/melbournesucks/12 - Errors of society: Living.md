As i type this message, i can hear the screams of pain and injustice of my neighbour, as the federal police attempt to 'disarm' him with pepper spray and a highly collaborated spear gun. Is it fair? Even i can't answer that question which brings me to my observation that suggests that he did deserve it. Who knows, He could have been an overly addicted drug user, that killed people by night and sold off their limbs and guts to find new and better ways to inject cocaine into his vains, or perhaps he was just the normal person i knew. So somehow, after talking about my neighbour, we come to the beginning of a conclusion that 'Living' can be a fatal error in society, that will leave you twitching and bleeding like the bastard you always were.

How is this so? Let me explain........As an alleged scientist, i spend a majority of my time repairing and constructing body parts with the minimal of preparation, which would explain my low success rate. Anyhow, after conducting several experiments on rats, i later discovered that our lives at risk, as living can be tough among evil anime doers and the like. So what can i do the combat the very essence that has been clutching us for billions of years, commonly known as 'life'?

To 'Stop Living', would be a very simple and direct answer, but Julius, you still haven't told me why our lives are at threat? I seem to live a very productive and normal life, what could possibly be at threat? Answer: Everything. Even as you live your normal life eating cereal and attending church, the likely possibility of you dying is at an all time high. Even that muesli bar you're possibly eating right now is perhaps contaminated with high traces of lead and seven of the five toxins in rat poison. How do you feel now? Afraid? Now i'm not suggesting that you stop eating muesli bars altogether, (Although your knowledge of this blog is a perfect reason to have you perished), we must understand that some of these toxins may be healthy in small dosages.

These may include Tiberium*, Arsenic, Vitamin D and various other combinations of deadly substances. Every Sunday, I try and fit in a plain bowl of Lead Arsenate, which not only acts as a great substitute for sugar, but also helps replenish that nutritional goodness, including all the Vitamins (A through to Z) and a combination of useless proteins (Good for Growth stunting). Ever tryed Moth balls? No? Why not try a couple sprinkles of sulfur between two pieces of bread, a quick dinner, served for six. Not your thing? Then how about "The alternative Slurpee"? A combination of noxious metals, brewed to create "flavour X", a great starting point for people who want to lose weight, while the drink maintains that great, natural flavour from which most Slurpees retain. But the best thing is, you get to chose the metals and in which order you blend them!!!!!!! (Overflow of excitement.......)

So there we have it once again by some crazy individual, whom is falsely endorsing that "Something or rather" is good for you. While preserving Conservative comment within my band of intellectual spy's. Basically, i have no life. And either do you. (I actually do have a life, i think*)
