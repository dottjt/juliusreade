As i stare down at the floor, i see bits of vomit and an empty beer can, resembling the complex makings of a 'Bong'. Searching even deeper, i soon discover the left over remains of a chicken liver, stained with coke and raw blood. These descriptions may disturb the inner soul of some people, and sexually favour the rest. Whatever your reason, please do remember this: That 'it isn't always as seems'. Who knows whether that vomit was actually the carcass remains of a deer or perhaps the deteriorated remains of an 8 year old child, draped in sewerage and leather fillings. Maybe i don't even have a floor, but how is someone to tell the difference?

"Beneath the dark ruins of the long-lost Egyptian pyramids, remains more gold than anywhere else in the world." This statement could very well be true, however there is one clear mistake. It is a very well known FACT*, that Gold was in fact invented in the 1950's, so therefore impossible 3000 years ago. Now although the previous statement is POSSIBLY incorrect, there is MORE of a chance that it is truthful, rather than false. How? It's called 'Bending the truth' and works in many situations and scenario's.

Let's imagine that you had kids with a woman of some sort, (Although highly unlikely, considering you read these kind of articles) and you get a divorce. Now in the most fortunate of cases you might lose custody to those children and remain Happy for the rest of your life (I don't particularly like young children), but what if all else fails and you do IN FACT gain custody of those children? You'll be living the rest of your life as miserable chap, with no wanted help or self esteem. In this case, bending the truth can help you achieve whatever path you choose. If you really want the kids (Not advised), then claim how your ex-wife used to bash you up during dinner, or perhaps that she is a bad parent for watching anime. In this instance, the police will be so concentrated and emotionally moved by your claims, that they won't even bother to listen to your ex-wife, and will lock her up for the rest of her life or execution*. (Anything relating to this last sentence is, Highly unlikely, as with most things i type.)

As a child, i never told lies (Debatable) and was also honest and truthfull. But despite my nature, i was constantly being picked on by bullies and teased on for not being bullied enough. Things changed however, after i started telling lies, as well as the alleged hardcore drugs. Now aside the fact that i was apparently doing hardcore drugs, i was also making new friends, often with the 'wrong crowd', but also building my self-esteem at the same time. So if you have learnt anything today, remember that you should never do 'illegal' drugs, while trying to become a better person, as the two things just don't mix.............., unless if your parents say so.
