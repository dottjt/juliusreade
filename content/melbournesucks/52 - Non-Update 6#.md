Much like in my previous Blog, i plan to create another 'Top Song List', this time, i'll only choose my favourite songs, that'll always sound good, matter how many times i listen to it? Not only because I need to concentrate on up-comming exams (WTF!!!!~~, did somebody say Exams!!!), but also because i need to take a short break on writing these fking articles. (Basically, when you think that I'm actually spending time making this song list, I'm actually playing videogames..........oh and of course studying ;)

Plus, I just got my 'audio recorder' and plan to 'record stuff', (Duh. Anyways, i highly advise you to get one. You'll understand when your older. As with having a camera..........."

Oh and come on, plz watch my youtube vid: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgWW5aoO3mY

Actually, i'll still be writing articles, but not publishing them, so that'll look like I wrote all of them at once and everybody will be like "Thats guy's PRO-as, I want to sleep with him!!!!!!!" (Doubt that will work, considering the fact that i have NO viewers/readers. Oh by the way, if you are reading this......cool..................AND HOW ABOUT LEAVIN' A DAMN COMMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
