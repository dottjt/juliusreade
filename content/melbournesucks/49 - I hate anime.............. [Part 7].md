I don't hate anime, it just sucks. It just so happens that i hate anime, because it sucks. Not because I'm biased (then again.......) or because it has mentally damaged me for life (Likely), but because it just plain sucks. Ask a scientist, and they'll tell you that it also sucks. John Howard once said that: "Anime was the reason why i lost the election", But can we trust such a man as John Winston Howard? When i walk down street, i can clearly hear the voices of nearby pedestrians chanting out the 5 main reasons why it sucks and yet what are they? Well.........:

It's quite clear: If you don't know what the hell this reason means, then obviously you haven't been influenced by my previous posts. Apart from their factual value, may my previous posts' influence YOU and YOUR WAYS to become more like ME. (And trust me, you DO NOT want to be like me........)

Cause the scientist "allegedly" said-so: If you don't trust me, then why not the word of a scientist? Last Sunday, it had been positively confirmed that anime could possibly influence the way we think and relate to life. Now that may not be a bad thing, but..............nvm~~crap.

Anime is bad for you?: Although not proved, anime is definitely bad for the way we live our lives, greatly impacting on our health and well being. How? Just take a good, hard look at a Japan..................and you'll find absolutely nothing wrong with them \**wink* wink** ......(whisper:** You know what I'm talking about~~ ;sorta).........

I'm running out of ideas: Now I'm no fan of anime myself, but from looking at my friends taking this "so-called-entertainment', I found a large improvement in happiness levels and self-awareness................AH DAMN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't have a clue: At the end of the day it really does depends on what you ultimately like to do: 'Watching anime' or 'Live a life of intense hell and suffering'..................Wait a sec, aren't they the same thing??? (HAHAHAHAHA, yet a lame, but intentional joke).

Hopefully you've learnt much from my teachings, and will have even more 'helpful' knowledge on how anime does and doesn't work..........(WTF!!!)
