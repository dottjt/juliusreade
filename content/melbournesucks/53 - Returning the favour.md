In order for one to successfully 'return the favour', one must be well prepared, mentally as well as physically. Depending on the situation of hate/anger, it's best that no one have the knowledge of about what 'is' or 'will' happen to your victim. In terms of revenge, your 'counter-attack' should always be AT LEAST a hundred times worse than he/she had done to you. Not only do they deserve this allegedly, unintended punishment, but in addition, it can be quite rewarding. However, let us start with the basic's in terms of what to do.

Firstly, what the hell made you want to have revenge?

"It's not like i have a grudge or anything.....it's just want to have you dead".
