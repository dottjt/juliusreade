At times, life can be annoying, it can be enjoyable, it can even lead to some of your worst personal choices (Watching anime), but yet it can't offer hope to those in poorer countries. While you read this article in sheer boredom, a pair of black orphans are vigorously 'humping' each other, in a desperate attempt to try and keep warm, as well as to have a 'specia kind ofl fun'. By all means, let the Children of South Africa have sex in front of the entire family, but why should they gravely suffer in terms of surviving the daily struggles of 'life'?

It is well known that most African countries are corrupt, so why not also the people? Last summer, i had the 'overstated' privilege of visiting the poor, struggling nation of Sudan, and boy i must say i saw some quite shocking sights. Walking down the street, Sudanese children harmfully laughed at ME, pointing their evil fingers at ME, as if i was some sort of outsider, (Clearly not). I couldn't take the unnatural happiness of the children, it was just too 'overwhelming' for me. Slowly walking over, i snapped that child's head off and gave it to my fair wife as a birthday gift. Not only am i now divorced with that ugly b*tch, but was immediately put in jail for 10 years, despite the fact i had apologised. (With my mouth and middle finger).

When I watch TV and see those hopeless ads based on helping African orphans, I hit my sister and push her onto the floor. Not because of the ad, but because i felt like doing it. No matter what the ad (or sistuation), I usually slap my sister, leaving her twitching and bleeding to her very life. But aside from my silly and playful actions, I have a good think about whether i really want to sacrifice $5 a month to try and help someone i don't even know. What if that black orphan in the ad was just faking the poor conditions he lives in, and was in fact making a living through stealing offshore bank accounts, while murdering and stealing the/from the rich? I wouldn't actually know, in fact i don't really care, so let's move onto he next exciting paragraph, where i just highlight random words.

Being brought up by 5 different sets of parents, i finally learnt to read, write and speak simultaneously at the 'tender' age of 12. Yet, people said that it was complete bullsh*t, and that it was impossible to do such a thing. So in 1998, i defied the entire population of Australia and spoke, wrote while reading. Much like my own personal cause, the black orphans are much the same thing, only that they DID NOT succeed in the end. In fact they did absolutely NONE of those things, and will continue NOT TO for the next hundred years, or so.

Welcome to my conclusion of this article, displaying even more randomness of highlighting words, now including extra grammatical errors, not to mention the added extra of 'Racial Slurs'. If you haven't learnt any thing from this article, remember this, that no matter how smart, wise, cool, intelligent, educated, sexy you are: It was NOT smart, wise, cool, intelligent, educated, sexy to read this article, especially UP TO HERE.
