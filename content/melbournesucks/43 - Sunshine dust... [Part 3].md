"Enjoyment had become a thing of the past, forgotten to be passed down from each generation........."

I'm thinking about fleeing the borders to somewhere safer, but i already know it's too late. The soldiers from the South had already taken my wife, but the kids don't know that. I don't know how I'll tell them, i really don't. I remember when my dad told me the bad news, i thought it was all my fault. I tried killing myself, and i don't my kids to make the same mistake, but i know they're strong willed. I think i might leave it for a little longer, until they're older.

My memories are coming back to me, although my doctor suggested it to be a bad thing. I remembered when my dad used to take me fishing on the tireless weekends. So far I've only remembered 'Good memories', which means I'm safe for now, although you can never be too sure. I'm getting vaccinated to remove all my thoughts and memories to minimise the risk of being 'infected'. I wouldn't risk turning into one of them 'evil soldiers', it's just a risk i can't take, especially for the kids. It was horrifying to see my sister be consumed by 'The bad memories virus'. It transferred all her self-conscienceness and self-control to the 'rebel leader'. No one really knows why, except for the evil creator of the virus, Lord Vain. Not only is he responsible for the fall of 'our kind', but has been responsible for the many spells and curses put on people, not the mention the main leader of the rebel forces from the south.

Ever since the Black Plague, Lord Vain has been terrorising our people with the worst of diseases. If he was here right now I'd.., I'd, I'd rather not talk about it. Whenever we 'people' try to do some good on this earth, he just equally destroys our hopes and complicates our lives even more. Sometimes, I regret not killing myself as a child, long, long ago...........
