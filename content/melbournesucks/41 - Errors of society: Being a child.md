When i walk down the road and see a little child of young appearance, i die a little inside and want to punch the cr*p out of him/her. Not only to let out my inner frustration from daily bullying and general hate from the public, but mainly because he/she was a child. If it was a pedophile or perhaps a member of the Klu Klux clan, i would have happily shaked that persons hand and continued to watch their evil doing to helpless minorities and children*. However, when i have to walk pass a child each time i cross the road to get to KFC, i contain the inner hatred and later let it out on my little sister. Here's a 'neat' list of the reasons why you too, should bash your sister*:

They just, plain, suck: It's only natural to hate children, and a good reason why is because they just suck. They often serve 'no' or 'little purpose' in life and sometimes act as a deterrent to society's ways. So when i see an underaged child, i allegedly knee-cork[1] that son-of-a-b*tch and run away like a coward. Therefore, leaving the child in a venerable position against stalkers and killer eagles, eagerly circling the sky, waiting for its next prey...........(WTF?!?)

They don't take much to 'harm': Children are vulnerable basically because...........they're kids. This not only makes you feel tougher and bigger when in the presence of a child (although you probably already are), but also gives out the simple message, "That If you mess with me, You're history!!". Now i know it's highly unlikely that a child would even bother to attempt to attack someone bigger than themselves, but just in case if it happens, have your pocket-knife ready to strike, and a kilogram of c4 strapped to your body, just in case ALL goes wrong........(Suicide).

They tend to be 'Annoying': The most common 'annoyance' would have to be when you're on the train or some form of child infested area (etc. school) and you then decide to play your Portable gaming system of choice, (Hopefully not PSP). Now i have absolutely nothing wrong with playing my Nintendo DS in public, but when 50 freakin' children gather to see what you'r e playing.............it just pisses me off. Not only am i not allowed to Sac-tap[2] the bunch of 'ill-ridden' idiots, but i have to bear with these freaks, until the lunchtime finishes..............DAMN CHILDREN!~!! I JUST WANT TO PLAY A DAMN GAME OF POKEMON WITH MY FRIEND FOR 5 MINUTES AND YOU JUST RUIN EVERYTHING!~!~!!!~!!......(fk~)

I can't think of anything else: I hate many things, (Child-Actors, Anime, Maplestory, Noobs, Anyone in a lower grade than me, MMORPG's, paying for things, uploading, socialising, idiots, enemies, The fact that no one has SSBB (yet), Halo, Xbox, The elderly, Religious people, people whom want to free Tibet, Girls who scream, homework..............), but non more than children because..........i'll just say it's so obvious i won't need to tell you...

Hopefully* you have become a better person from reading this article and so therefore, more like me. Why??, i don't have a clue, especially why i even wrote this article............
