Sometimes school may seem like a drag with a constant flow of homework and bullying......but not if you're well prepared like me. Everyday, i bet you start school with a frown on your face and a thought in your head personally knowing that your English teacher will shout at you, merely because you didn't finish your crappy assignment. Well with my advice and your patience to read this guide, you'll be having fun in no time and to think it's all thanks to me..................

Now there are many reasons why naughty school children like you do what you, and it's partially understandable. Whether your uncle raped you as a child or perhaps your best friend wants you dead, your actions can be replaced with 'other' less destructive ways. Usually, i like to take out my anger and frustration on the smaller kiddies at school. Not only will you look like a prick for harming smaller kids and making them feel insecure, but also regain your inner strength to survive the school day. Personally, but allegedly i find that using surrounding utilities and objects can make the task seem more 'pleasant'. However, do realise that there is an immense amount of risk when picking on a younger generation of students. In most cases, you might have to say: "If you tell a teacher, I'll hurt you even more next time", "Pretty Please" or, "I'll be your best friend if you don't tell?"

So now that you have all the confidence you need to live through school life, you might want to find other ways to entertain yourself during class. When I'm in the classroom, i like to cause mischief while not being caught, and here are just a few tips to pull off some of those 'higher risk' pranks. Firstly, before you set up a prank, always have another person idle to put the blame on. When I'm just about to set my friends desk on fire, i don't just set it on fire from my current position. I wait until the teacher turns around and then i walk behind my 'best friends' desk and then throw the Molotov cocktail. This way, the teacher will OBVIOUSLY suspect it was your 'best friend' and not 'you', behind the eventual burning down of the entire school. But remember, if all else fails, suicide is an allegedly REASONABLE, but possibly REGRETFUL OPTION.

Thanks to peer-pressure, you and your new friends will now be on top of pecking order, being only slightly less popular than the nerds. This doesn't mean you can't have fun and still joke around. What this means is that you have been one of the many successful followers of myself, and have greately benefited from one of my guides. It doesn't matter about what the police say about my criminal record, at least your living the dreamlife, happily licking the residue off your elderly sisters underwear, while tearing away pieces of paper to facilite your cigarette and marajuna needs.......
