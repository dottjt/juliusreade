Never in my life would i think about hurting the feelings of any religious persons or people from religious backgrounds.......until today. In fact, I've been diluting and disgracing the religious system from since i was a very young and brainwashed child. So why hasn't god stopped me? Or maybe he just doesn't exist. Besides, chanting doesn't guarantee success or luck. I think perhaps there's better reasons to become religious, socially and idiotically:

It makes you seem less 'insane' when a coincidence occurs etc. Winning the lottery. But more importantly, you can discuss it with your idiot friends and tell them how praying to god helped........ apart from the fact that you've been trying to win the lottery for the past 20 years. And so what if god can answer prayers? I can walk, much like how you believe in a religion. So next time something good happens, blame it on god and he shall blame your sin????

Joining a religion helps purify your inner soul and help cleanse out the bad spirits.........or so the bible dictates. Ask anyone, and they tell you that religion is good and that killing is bad. I asked a person last Sunday and guess what he said? The exact same answer, THEREFORE suggesting that all religious people are crazy and morally 'incompatible'??????

Now I'm no rocket scientist, but It's a well known fact that religion can offer help and peace of mind during times of struggle. Although i can't prove this, I'm sure if you ask your local priest (Make sure he/shemale is not corrupt) or perhaps that homeless man down the road; they'll happily tell you that what i just previously stated was correct and that the Jewish people believe in some sort of 'made-up-religion'???????????????

As well as religion's commonly mistaken feature (That religion is bad), religion can in fact SAVE LIVES. From years of beneficial 'Sunday school' down at the local church, I've learnt many practices and made up theory's, such as the reason you shouldn't harass women and that other religions are BAD. In addition, we also learnt about candy and how it can lead to being raped. I never really enjoyed the re-enactments, but at least it was a female for a change........??????????????????????????????????????????????????

There's nothing worse than waking up and finding bits and pieces of your dogs brain, splattered all over the bed sheets, but now with religion there's no telling what could happen???????? (WTF?, Even i don't know what that means)

uh........ok then. Unfortunately for me, i know shit all about religion and so therefore decide to finish this article with my full name and then writing a quote relating to how meaningless this article is.
