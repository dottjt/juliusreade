Looking back at my older articles, i see many mistakes, including some that just make me go 'WTF'? So if you do see any mistasks, plz write a comment of sumthing. Reason being, i can't be bothered going through 30+ articles just to fix these very noticeable mistakes, (I don't take as much care as i should). This shall serve as a reminder to myself, or any 'accidental' readers. In addition, i have posted most of my old articles from Adelaidesucks at the end part of all the posts.

If anybody is reading through all these articles, remember to read from UP to DOWN, cause a lot of my earlier stuff is so bad that even i feel a bit wierd reading it. (I was slightly younger back then).

Achievement: I have now written around 23,251 words in total and around 240 paragraphs in 5 months (62 articles). In retrospect in guess it isn't that much compared to other people, but I'm getting there.........
