As a potential murder, i occasionaly enjoy the feeble site of a young member in our society, being brutally prolonged the gift of a dagger to the throat, by a 15 year old gang leader. But whats wrong about that? Are you suggesting that it could be morally wrong? Well consider this, how would you feel to be that 15 year old kid. Put yourself in his position and consider the possbility of getting caught, from "doing his buisness". Let alone the risk of guilt and an empty wallet, it really is a shameful and tough life. So cut some slack and allegedly help out these people, and only with a minimal of effort.

So what if that innocent woman died, it could of been for a number reasonable causes and explanations. Perhaps she was a murdered or some form of evil human? Or even more realisticly, paid him for her painful death experience? Whatever the reason, put down your phone and don't call the police, because I'm sure that 15 year old kid had only the best of intentions of ending her short-lived life. Remember, murderers have feelings too........

But what do i do if I'm in the situation of being murdered? Simple, ignore them and they will instantaniously leave. In fact, try it right now. Threaten to harm you next door neighbours children and then rock up to their house asking if you can come in, just as if nothing had happened*. Works (almost) Everytime.*

What to do now.........Oh i know. Get a life and stop reading this Anuirudh.
