Anime: At first, an attractive non-religious solution for young, hopeless girls looking for remedial enlightenment, soon to be depraved and corrupt of their moral values and rights, until their last breath of noxious aesthetics poisoning. Now as shocking as that sounds, it certainly is unarguably correct and in many aspects truthful. Leaving unfortunate families of 6 or more to fend for themselves, day and night, hot and cold, and in the most hostile and unbearable of conditions, simply in order to survive the harsh reality that is themself........

So perhaps i was slightly exaggerating, but it has been theoretically and practically proven by experts that anime has threaten customary way of life, that has remained untouched for decades of years. Although i don't condone death, i do happily suggest that anyone attracted to anime, should be put to death through various methods of slow torcher. Which thankfully brings me to my 5th lesson in the hating anime trilogy: Stabbing.

Now there are many ways to stab or in any case, physically dismantle the typical or severe anime fan, but what is the best method and if i use a stainless steel knife, will it be easier to clean up after? Wait Wait Wait, just hold your horses and let's begin with the basics, Technique.

Now with experience comes improved aim and objective. Up until now, I'm guessing that you've been taught by your parent or guardian that underarm is most safe and accurate, but may i tell you otherwise. As a professional, i have allegedly killed and executed many people back in my day, but i've found that a direct jab into the kidney, lung or throat works best on most individuals, escpecially children. However, what if the freak is holding a gun or worse an anime fan? This is where your Equipment or as us professionals say 'preparation', comes in handy.

Depending on your wealth and state of prosperity, you might want to consider carrying several armaments, in case of the possibility, that several people may attack you. I personally find that carrying 2 daggers, a butcher knife and several ninja stars will usually last a couple of days and nights, heavily depending on which Asian based-suburb you live in. Now you might find it quite difficult to obtain these items of illegal value, but don't worry because with a few household appliances you too, can have the arsenal of your dreams*.

A perfect example, a piece of cardboard with the word 'knife' written on it; stuck on to the end of a stick, the perfect recreation of a deadly switchblade. Don't own cardboard? Then sticky tape a few straws onto the outsides of a disc, the perfected and remastered creation of a ninja star. Perhaps you don't have a few discs lying around? Then how about blue tacking a deck of playing cards onto the back of a spoon, the ideal reformation of a deadly utility knife. But remember, there is no limit when it comes to experimenting with and dangerous, sharps objects like discs and straws.

So there you have it yet again. Always remember to experiment and do what works out for you. If you don't enjoy my jabbing technique, then perhaps try overarm and it doesn't hurt to throw once in a while........
