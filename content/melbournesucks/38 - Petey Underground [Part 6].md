Petey's former life was one to be cherished and admired. One that would breach the full potential and hope of his life, until that fatal day. The day were he would no longer smile, while his school books would gather dust. He would go until noticed into society, avoided by the many friendly and dark faces of his community. Although it was not the end, it was surely to be the beginning of one. The very beginning of Petey's destiny as a lone man. Now only cherished and admired by the evil men in dark suits. His creators..........

Petey's understanding of life was to kill the innocent souls that emotionally displeased him. To the average person, these understandings were normal, such as laughter and happiness. But to Petey.........it pissed him off and provoked him. So much so, that he carries a gun and attempts to shoot people displaying these emotions. Yet, Petey never really understood what emotions were. He would see people smile and then just stare at them in complete amazment and wonder. To Petey, a smile signified hate and pain. It revealed that you were weak and useless, oh so Petey thought.

It wasn't long before Petey knew that these emotions were bad and evil. He couldn't take it, he needed to 'let out' and free the devil within. With that devil, 150 lives were lost, yet gained in Peteys conscience. He felt happy after what he had done and wanted to do it again. For some reason, it just came naturally to him, but It was too late. As Petey ran wildly towards a crowd of people with his knife, a distant policeman shot him several times in the head.............He had no self control and his parents knew that.

After the incident, Petey just woke up lost of memory. Name, Age, Personality; all gone, he couldn't remember a thing. He could feel wires moving through out his body, but he was just happy to be alive. Deep down inside, Petey knew he had one purpose in life, one goal. Programmed, Petey had one priority and that was to kill. His first victim was going to be easy............
