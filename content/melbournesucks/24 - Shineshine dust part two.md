"I can feel the wind, but only in my mind........."

My people have only a few days to live before the soldiers from the South reach us. The medical specialists said that i was going to die of the virus anyway, so i didn't worry too much. I was never really was scared of death, but never really liked it either. You never really think about it until you realise it's coming, and even then, it can't be stopped......

Friends and family felt like a thing of the past. There's rarely any time for fun in this day and age. Each morning i go hunting with my squadron for food, just so we can survive. One time we ate our engineer specialist because he wouldn't shut up about the pain in his left arm. Our leader shot him and we ate him for breakfast the next morning. I felt sorry for him, but felt that he deserved it. You don't really realise how sick you really are, until you eat your best friend.

Before the virus, this world used to be a happy place. Sometimes during my guard duty, i would drift off into a world where the virus had been cured and the world had united. No more killings. Peace through out. But even for a man like me, i knew that it would never happen. Even if the rebel forces from the South had all died from the virus and everything was restored back to normal, the mutual darkness from beneath the city would eventually rise and kill everybody. Including the planet itself...............
