I don't usually fail tests, but when push comes to shove, it's sometimes necessary to fail certain tests, even the really important ones. Tests are specifically designed to be failed, although in some cases, this simply isn't possible. Sarah for example, had recently failed her year 9 biology test, from which she dropped out of school and etc. Later in life though, while she's smoking a bong with her friends, or perhaps beating her lesbian girlfriend with a stick; It'll be quite clear that she has screwed up her life in such a way, thankfully because of stupidness or idiocy for failing a test, that essentially didn't occur to anybody else. In other words, if you screw up a test, you are either an idiot or just plain stupid.

Now I'm not here to exploit the bright, but yet unintelligent minds of today's generation (me), but to however offer support at a time where it is badly needed to help facilitate the scum and hope-less people of tomorrow's future. In such cases, it would be wise for me to write up 'another one of them' articles, trying to persuade you to do drugs and etc. However, today i shall teach you a much more meaningful lesson in life: The ability to be smart. I currently understand that to your further knowledge of extent, you do not currently understand the meaning of such words as 'wise' and 'smart', which is why i have taken the time and courtesy to highlight them for you, basically to signify the contents of this article, mainly for my 'less bright of an 'audience'*.

First things first, you've obviously stuffed up life/in the head, understand no or little English, are or am a retard and are still trying to figure out what this article is actually about, as with the 'Enter' button on your keyboard. If not, you're even more stupid than the rest, as you shouldn't be wasting your time, reading such undermining filth, that even I don't understand. So now that I've/we've acknowledge your 'true self', we must quickly move on to Phase two; from which i make you feel even more crap about yourself and then; Phase three which is one of the more important phases, from which something BENEFICIAL actually happens. (In terms of the 'common idiot';BENEFITIAL: It's sorta like when you snort cocaine, only without the downside of feeling crap afterwards).

In order for ME to 'transform' YOU, with the power of my sexiness and so-forth, I'll need to know that YOU are indeed committed to a complete life change in life style, one that will guarantee you a place into Melbourne Uni* and perhaps a slightly hotter girlfriend, than your current sister-in-law*. But then again, do i really want to help a person, such as the low-life that comprises YOU? Not really, however, ever since my brutal encounter with god as a child, I've discovered that helping other people can only benefit, and in this case, I've implied the same theorem. So on the count of Three, i want you to close your eyes, and locate the Red-cross in the top hand corner of the screen and click it repeatedly until you feel mentally sick. Not only will you become void of an further more brainwashing, but you'll also become pure and even more true to your self. (Hopefully, you'll stop your daily intake of drugs and adopt hard-work and civil+moral rights for the rest of your damn life.)

So just imagine you can hear my voice (No, the crazy voices inside your head, telling you to take one more smoke from your joint), but instead ME, and image that I'm actually in front of you............

1..........2............3*((*(BANG()*(*())!@#

You my friend, are now a bigger idiot than previously thought, however, not all hope is lost. You still have your drug-ridden family and friends that will hopefully guide you throughout life, leading you into mis-leading situations, always managing to have the better of you. But i don't really care because if i stand corrected, you just closed your browser...............idiot. But then again, it's sorta hard to hear words..................
