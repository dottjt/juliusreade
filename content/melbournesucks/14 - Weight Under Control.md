Many fortunate people around the world have the misconcepted privilege of being over weight. So why do people complain about being morbidly obese? Always try and look at things from a positive point of view, as poorly displayed by this blog. You may be large but think of it as an advantage against other large people. You may be heavier than them, but look at it as a possibility to lose more weight than they can. Or perhaps you can look at it as an advantage to do things that normal people can't. Saying things like, "I smashed anorexia in the face" or "I'll kick your ass in an eating competition", will most likely boost your confidence, provided you don't say it aloud out in public. But those are merely 'weak arguments' compared to reasons against being over weight, which is why i decide to take this discussion into an extended session.

Funny that, did somebody say my chubby, 15 year old friend is hot? Why thank you, pretty 18 year old teenager wearing only the minimal of clothing, deemed legal. So as we can see from this simplistic example, being over weight is not only acceptable in a society filled with realistic people and expectations, but also attractive to pretty, 18 year old teenagers whom there is an abundance of. However, may i suggest that if you are a pedo and/or a contract killer, my method will not work. Firstly, the fact that i takes time to gain weight and the simple fact that girls do have birthdays on a yearly basis, therefore: will move on from being 18. (Basically means that my method is rendered useless after 18 years old*).

In addition to being rather attractive, being 'sizeable' is another way of saying that i care and that you're most likely a trustable person, with a large heart. Why don't you ever see skinny 'so-called' people help others? Because as we all know skinny people, are a selfish people. Constantly gathering raw materials in order to survive another day of misery and hopeless possibilities that one day, they too can be as healthy as the average 'obese' person/s. SO what if people insult you for your weight, just insult them back. Saying "Your ugly" or "At least my parents love me" usually works, provided you yet again don't say it out aloud in public, let alone use it.

Don't hate your inner person. Let it flourish and provide you with the necessary tools to strive towards your dreams and thoughts of the like. Even if you are 'skeletal' or 'As thin as a stick', if you know what i mean...........
