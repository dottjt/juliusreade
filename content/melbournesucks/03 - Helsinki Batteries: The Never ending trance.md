Last week i visited my doctor in regards to my drug addiction and yet I'm still taking cocaine for relaxation, which suggests that doctors aren't and haven't been doing their job properly. Very recently, a doctor was caught having a threesome during surgery, with the patient and staff, from which he merely replied, 'Couldn't help myself'. Now as a reformed Christan and racist, i oppose all criticism directed at doctors and beg our young, concerned liberals that the modern doctors' practices' are completely sane and correct. You try not having sex during surgery or giving a patient the wrong medication. It ain't easy, escpecially if your not a doctor. But apart from the whole 'Killing our patients' theme, let us dive into a world of mystery which is, 'The Doctor'.

Now assuming that doctors get paid large amounts of money, it would be wise and accurate to say that it would be rather temping to waste money on drugs and hookers during all hours of the day, even during work. So when a doctor comes into work with crack on his nose, and a needle and strap on his arm, it probably means that he's profession, relating back to how much money he can spend on drugs. But aside the fact that he too, is probably addicted to a combination of medication and amphetamines, we really must focus on the more important aspects like, the amount of money he/she earns, or the number of patients he/she hasn't killed.

Professionally speaking, us/we, being the refined public should be aware that being a doctor can be tough and daunting at times. What with all the money he/she has to waste on 'extras' like a new car or wife, we must also understand that there are many downsides within the few, that apply to living a 'high life' of a doctor. This may include coming home late with only 5 sex workers instead of the usual 10, or the fact that he or she doesn't own a personal slave from Africa. These factors can and will often drive doctors into a orgy of hell and underclass living. Not to mention the possibility that they might have to actually begin working for a living, (Remember not to be confused with nurses).

So now i hope that you've learnt that doctors are fragile but valuable people that heavily contribute to a growing population, that one day will look up to doctors and ask for their help. Think into the future, when your face is bleeding after a car accident that involved an intoxicated doctor crashing into you and then maracuously saving your life afterwards. Could happen to anyone, it's just not very likely...........
