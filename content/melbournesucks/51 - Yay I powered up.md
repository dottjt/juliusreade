When i 'power/level up' in a video game i feel deeply liberated, when in reality I've just died a little inside. Often, I'll grunt or shout "POWERED UP!!!!" really loudly, just to let my neighbours know. If that doesn't get the message across, i'll usually run to everybody's house in the neighbourhood, and tell them that I've leveled up, before decking their pants and running off like a little brat. Sometimes, when i have an extra bit of time up my sleeve, i'll put up a banner in front of my house, stating that I've 'leveled up'. So am i insane, or should i stop taking those illegal drugs my parents allegedly force me to take?

A majority of my time is spent in the library, Gold Farming with my 'lvl 2,376 Runescape account', while making sure i don't pwn too many noobs . My imaginary friends tell me that I'm just crazy, but I know that I'm doing the right thing by 'them' and by 'me'. How? Well thank God for Runescape, because I've never socialised with anyone (mainly girls, boys, humans in general etc.), often resulting into 'intense, nervous break downs' whenever i talk to other people, (Even on msn). Although this may sound like a bad thing, it certainly isn't 'as bad as it seems*'. I still manage to have a girlfriend (CS bot) and a couple of children (on the Sims), and although my girlfriend looks like a terrorist, she looks rather hot in my custom made 'Bikini outfit', using an illegal copy of photoshop and several pairs of 'girls clothing' i apparently found in my neighbours house, that you really shouldn't know about..........

Now you can't say that i haven't tried to socialise though. When i go lanning by myself on Monday, Tuesday, Wedne..............well everyday, i usually spent hours on end, waiting for someone to connect to the damn game, but i just can't understand why? I mean, I don't even have an Internet connection, let alone a computer as with friends, so i still haven't figured out what I've done wrong? However, every Saturday I usually spend an hour a night, playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl, with four controllers simultaneously, by myself. Not only does it feel like I'm socialising and playing with real people, but it also gives me the confidence to look at the girl across the road, before falling into a deep acoma, while suffering severe random seizures from over-excitement. I remember once i saw her with no clothes on at night, and my heart just stopped beating, quite literally.

Stalking may be a criminal offence, but it doesn't hurt to spend a couple of hours each night, staring through the front bedroom window of your neighbours house, right? Okay, so maybe it's just a bit mean for my parents think that i died in a fatal car accident, when really I'm just secretly living in the undiscovered attic in the roof, but it's not as bad as you think it is. At least i can play some SSB or Runescape at night, without the annoying remarks from my parents to tell me to get off the "F*cking computer". Nothing's worse than when your trying to play Runescape and your parents are telling you to get off the computer, or they would 'sexually harm' you, "You worthless peice of.........."

I you haven't learnt anything today from reading this article, may i advise you NOT to play Runescape for 48 hours straight, while high off narcotics and heroin. However, if you are a drug addict and are in desperate need of enlightenment, please don't play Runescape. Even if you don't take drugs, i still strongly recommend you not to play Runescape, even if it means no more sex for the rest of your life.........(Although if you've bothered reading up to here, it probably means that you are and will be a virgin for the rest of your life.........otherwise, Good Luck!!!!!)
