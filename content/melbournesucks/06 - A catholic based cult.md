A catholic based cult in the inner suburbs of Sydney has helped recent politicians to gain power over our schools and privately owned hospitals, for greater use of evil and death. Soon, they shall begin weakening our community leaders, while converting our Muslim brothers to a lesser position of Christianity. Even our men in white can't help the wrong doings of what was the greatest country of the 15th century............Spain.

The Spanish are stereotypically noted as a kind of dirty, ignorant bastard, whom lurks the dark alleyways of ancient Spanish settlement in seek of prey. From there, they drown the remains of children limbs and bones they had previously murdered, in an outer layer of crude oil, in which is then cooked inside a 2-metre basin of lotion and various garments. They are feared worldwide, but more importantly enjoyed by other 'infected' nations of the Crynian alliance.

Consisting of over 50 'former' nations, the Crynians base their life and rituals on the bloody crusades of the north, killing innocent people of similar decent, for food and lifestyle purposes. Occupying the recent ruins of the Romania, the Crynians remain a decent threat to 'our' way of life and resources. Although there has been much speculation into whether the Crynians are actually armed with life threatening weapons, despite the fact that all weapons pose a threat......

Even among our own cult of the ASD, are some of the Crynian's overbearing spys that demand our oil and make good use of 10% 'neutral' people. The neutral people are one-of-a-kind, with no friends and no apparent factor of feeling or sense. They hold the key to societies problems and believe that becoming of the mind, is one thought that shall not go unnoticed. Although it rarely does...........

Now if you've been reading everything up to \**HERE**, You are an idiot, because only two people actually know this url, (including me) and this 'article' doesn't even make sense........
