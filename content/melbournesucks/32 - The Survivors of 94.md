Many years had since passed the horrific events of 94', yet the memories from the past still stream through the minds of the remaining tormented survivors, eating through their mind, day by day. Socially leaving these people in such a vulnerable state, that a majority took their lives in a last attempt to regain their sanity. These events had been reported so horrific that even the bravest of the brave refuse to talk to anyone, including their caretakers. All day long, these survivors of the severe massacre, remain hidden inside a highly contained facility, away from society.............until now.

A world exclusive now presents: The Survivors of 94'. The professional team at 'Melbournesucks' have the honour and privilege to speak with the remaining survivors and their experiences with what went on during the mass killings:

"Yeah na, it wasn't too bad but I'm just pissed off with how slow my Internet is down here, in the basement."

"I hate it here in the basement. People think we're crazy, when really they just keep us here so they can make money off our stories. I think i might walk over there and start eating my own arm. By the way, I'm not crazy."

"They haven't changed my water bowl in days. Man what time is it, I'm starving!!!"

"So the other day, i was playing CS 1.6 with my best friend until the guards came and took him away. He hasn't returned since, but it's ok cause i can just play agianst the 'bots' anyway."

"Last night, the guards gassed the basement with steam. I don't know why, but the concept was really funny.........until my friend died."

"I caught Bill stealing my medical supplies so i stabbed him to death with my toothbrush. The guards sentenced me 'to be Hanged' next Tuesday, but I'm still not sure what that means."

"If it was anything that would cause me to suicide in here, it would definitely be the slow upload speeds on 'pornotube'. Perhaps the horrible conditions and the fact that the guards treat us like shit, but it's quite hard to 'crack a fat' while trying to wait for the next frame to load."

..........this and more, after the break.
