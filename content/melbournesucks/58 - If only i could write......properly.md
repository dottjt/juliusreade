After the recent disappointment of Spider man 2 and my ability to write, It would be completely accurate and sane, to say that i can't write for shit. When i read other peoples 'words', whether it be in Chinese or English, they always seem to be able to use their better 'vocabulary' and 'grammar' write better than me. Whereas i use the same fking words again and again, mainly because i haven't built up my vocabulary through the pussy method of reading and even more reading. Words such as "But" and "Fking" manage only to appear a couple of thousand times per article, which deeply saddens me and my current state of mind. Why is it that professionals (excluding myself), can write luscious sentences without the use of the word 'but' or 'cocaine'? Or perhaps write paragraphs describing the fine details of why she really 'got-it-on' with her 5th grade teacher? Well what irony, because I've decided to dedicate this article, in my 'weak' attempt and contribution to try and improve your skill in.............writing!!!!!!!!

Example professionalism: http://discoveringalice.blogspot.com/

"Finding the snooze button, I thumped it and groaned when I remembered why it was even on.
So, with reluctance, I heaved myself out of bed and trudged to the bathroom, through my cluttered room. Splashing some water on myself as I went to the sink, I glanced up at my reflection in the mirror.
What a mess."

So let's use this finely 'built' paragraph/s to try and teach YOU, (a child and/or pedophile of tomorrow) some further sense and knowledge into the finer skill of writing. Well, uh, um, well as we can see she's...........well firstly, the author has taken the time and liberty to describe the senseless crap out of the current situation. Such as where she describes an action as "thumping" , as opposed to...........something else. Why does it sound good? I don't have a damn clue why. In fact, i hate English. It's one of the most tedious and most useless subjects since Art. Actually, why don't we just abolish both subjects and replace them with maths 2 or perhaps another History subject..........

Happily moving on from my previous rant, the lesson learnt from today's lesson (Bad wording), is that a paragraph will always sound better with more words. Take my example, for example (More bad wording):

"As i entered the fking dungeon, i could feel something down my somewhere, but even i don't know what? Is could that be a happy and kind, but dangerous and killing spiders? I want not know, but i know what not i know, so i with my fat friend decided to take a closer lok with my big, black, dangerous eyes?!!*! "Then i laughed", he said!!!! So i looked cloder and it bit both my eyes, ears, legs, eyes and even my ears, with all mighty god-like laughter. It made me realay happy until i couldn't move, or see, or crouch, but who would want to crouch when playing with my gay, loser friend!!?"

If only you could have seen the professionalism and dedication put into writing that piece of rubbish. Ok, so maybe writing more words doesn't improve your ability to write, but there's one thing that's for sure. That if you can't write yet, you probably can't read, which means there really was no point in me writing this article........... :)
