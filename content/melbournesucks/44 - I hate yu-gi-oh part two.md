When somebody mentions the word "Yu-Gi-Oh", i think of death and suffering, not to mention the reason behind my night-time seizures. Because of this, i have become a better person, and so shall you, as i teach the humble man/woman (you) certain ways to suppress the dead, but lively "Yu-Gi-Oh" movements. Now i know that there is no actually Yu-Gi-Oh movement, in fact the card game is more so 'dormant' than anything. However, walking down the street yesterday, i was allegedly attacked by a group of Yu-Gi-Oh hoons and was able to successfully fend them off. With my bare hands, i chanted the secret word, and the group ran off quicker than the eye could see, (Massive exaggeration). How you say? Well i can't quite remember, but here are some other ways to 'suppress' the Yu-Gi-Oh movement:

- Convince the person to trade they're most rare card for a fake. (I doubt it will work)
- Pwn them in a game of Yu-Gi-Oh. (Very low success rate)
- Break they're arm. (Quite hard, illegal)
- Burn they're cards. (Don't even ask me how)
- Drug them, then take they're wallet. (Yeh, as if)
- Steal they're credit card number. (Now this is just getting ridiculous)
