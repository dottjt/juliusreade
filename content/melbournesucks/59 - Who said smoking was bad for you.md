Damn it people. I'm sick of you unkind, ungrateful, unholy idiots that choose to tell me that smoking is bad for your health and for society as a whole. I couldn't care less, because I know the real truth about smoking, which is what I'm here to discuss. People will tell you otherwise and i don't blame them, it really isn't their fault for being stupid. But how can they judge a product if they've never tried it? How do they know that it isn't beneficial for their health or perhaps a preventive to certain diseases, let alone their evil judgement against the otherwise useful* drug. However, does the science add up?

Maybe. I personally don't care, because in today's society we can never afford to take make the wrong decision and put our people at risk, which essentially is what science is doing. Back in the good old days when people weren't prone diseases like brainwashing and lung cancer, one thing always remained and that was people were smoking regardless of these useless warnings and have benefited greatly from this cause. Science and often people will claim that one-in-five smokers will die from a smoking related disease, but we all know (myself) that facts like these, just aren't true. I mean, how do we really know that the death was caused from a smoking related incidences? It could have been a number of various factors contributing to the overall death of a smoker. Perhaps the person was a member of the Labour party, or possibly an idiot (Same thing, HAHAHAHAHA, thats what we call a 'side joke')? However, all we know is that people die because god sent them, not because of an innocent packet of cigarettes.

At the end of the day, one-in-five smokers are either rapists, committed diers, people, or are crazily insane; or perhaps it's all just a massive coincidence? Everybody knows that cigarettes provide a large amount of income for the Australian government and other important countries of the world. So in other words, if you hate cigarettes, you hate your own country. Whether you consider this to be a good thing or not, treason is an offence that could have you PROSECUTED. Now i know that many of my younger and Labour party readers, are in fact looking through this article thinking: "What the hell does that highlighted word..............PROSECU,.. 'facts' mean". Well I'm here to tell you that it means something completely foreign to you, and possibly a little too complex for your brain and it's capacity to think properly, yourself being lied to all your life about the non-existent dangers of smoking, so i think we'll just move on.............

Overall, i think it would be fair to say that smoking is/and was legalized mainly for the health benefits for the people, and not for the benefit of the government, in terms of earning money. Yet another term my Labour party readers know nothing about, as with economic policy, and being popular. Actually, may i please take the time to endorse such fine institutions as the Australian Liberal Party, mostly for their fine work over 11 years in government, lead by the Sir Honorable, John Winston Howard. Moving on however, smoking has it's up sides and it's down...............well no, I've heard absolutely NOTHING but positive* comment about smoking and it's effects on humans. It may have damaged the lungs on poor little 'lab rats', but it certainly won't harm my fellow friends and comrades, fighting for our say on this 'already won' argument on Smoking. With our winners of course, being the Australian people........and friends ;)

PS: I certainly don't endorse smoking, however i do enjoy the extra tax we receive from our fine smokers.
