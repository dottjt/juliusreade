I've never supported the practice of taking drugs, but the selling of drugs...............Uh, as we all grow older and hopefully more fragile and lenient, we may choose to cherish certain aspects in life more than others, such as playing TF2 and other excellent and wonderful games from the steam collection. In no way would i want you to think that I am 'in fact' ENDORSING such companies, as respected examples: "Valve" and "Nintendo".....However, please do understand that these 'so-called' wonder companies actually deliver entertainment THAT REALLY FEELS LIKE YOUR HAVING A GOOD TIME!!!!!!......unlike that Halo crap and manga/anime.

Now I know that many of you (Mostly myself), have a keen interest in music and what not, which is why I've compiled a list of songs, also know as my top song list that I've been sizzling for the most part of this year..........but as they say "These things do take time", which is why It will be post-poned till further notice. (Basically,......Forever)

What i really meant to say was: If you really like games and have half a brain, go grab yourself a copy Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike : Source and have the time of your life. Or, if you really want to be distracted from life's mishaps and etc. get the "Orange box" for like $40 on Steam, which is like $8 a game. Or, If your an idiot like my alleged 'friend', go buy the "Orange Box" from EB, for the retail price of $100, you idiot.

So as my Wii gathers dust and eventually decomposes into the table (Somehow??), I'll be vigorously playing my Steam games, living in my small little world, much like in that movie "Trueman", starring Jim Carey, where everything is planned; a part from the fact that I'm not famous, and less talented..............in the meanwhile, my interest stored within this blog will die a faithful death, among some articles i wrote about hating anime.......a long time ago.
