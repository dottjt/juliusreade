"Whatâ€™s that mother? Destroy the economy mother?"........... But aside the point we picture politicians as a frail people, often caught in a sex scandals that end up on the front pages of tabloid newspapers. This my friends, is another word for saying that 'the Greens' are evil and unrealistic. Le introduce , as the French say:

The Greens: A bunch of depraved, socialistic homosexuals deported from the west, wishing to convert the entire working population into a bunch of murdering rapists, willing only to end the many years of prosperity, Howard has given the Australian people. Responsible for the downfall of jobs and mental depression in the 90's, the Greens have only the worst of intentions, including a recent proposal to demolish the IR laws, which yet again created by the Howard government, has given hope and has helped the many millions of hard working Australians to strive for their full potential in the work place. As Howard puts it, " It's your job before any possible joy or happiness". Actually, just look at it from your boss's point of view......

How would you feel to be paying over $50,000 a year to a useless employee/doctor, when some cheap labour from Afghanistan could be doing it for $50,000 dollars less? Think of it as: when the boss profits, so do you. The more the Boss earns, the more likely that more money is being passed down to 'you', (the physically unwanted)*. So don't worry when your employer sacks you, it was most likely a better decision for the company, rather than 'you', which is acceptable and operationally correct in a modern world filled with ethnic minorities and cheap labour. But what happens when cheap labour disappears and ironically, everyone in China dies of some unknown disease?

It's simple, you'll slowly degrade into a new social class of "idiot degenerates", from which you'll live off breast milk and eventually die from a lack of nutritional goodness and the combination of worldwide mass killings from instantaneously political revolutions, happening all around the world.......sigh.
