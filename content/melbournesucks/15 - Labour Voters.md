As a devoted conservatist, efficiently slaving away on fiscal policy to try and come up with smart and innovative ideas. Do i receive the death threats and complaints of the many ill-minded people, that simply don't understand intelligent discussion and thought. These people, somehow rare, are still abundant, mainly around Centrelink branches and often found around bins, vigorously digging through the dirt-filled trash in order to find a 'needle' to continue their experimentation with drugs. ONLY, and only would this kind of person not understand and realise the good work of the Coalition, but perhaps are labour voters, as a majority are. The other small percentage however, are lying calmly on their blood-stained carpet, twitching and shaking from a hard and long night of crack cocaine combined with hookers and various house mates, otherwise known as an 'average night out'.

Work. Very much a foreign word to the average labour voter, unless if you were to consider collecting a fortnightly doll payment as a positive reason. Besides, Theses versatile people have much more important issues to attend, such as getting their child tattooed with various slogans from ads or perhaps selling off their organs and blood for well needed drug money. Happily sucking and absorbing 'our' hard earned tax dollars, bastardly going to waste. Including the words : Prosperity, Brain and Labour, these people have not a basic clue, if not for the words: Evil, Kevin Rudd and Joint.

The concept of education is also quite unfamiliar within this group of Low-life Idiots. Constantly being abused by their elders, the unaware life of a child of a labour voter is hard, but in many cases, a necessity. I mean, how else would they get their drugs without the help of several baby bonuses? However, it still remains a mystery of the whereabouts of these missing generation of children. Most likely cut up, and snorted by their unstable parents. Or more accurately, sold off to illegal immigrants, to feed their ever growing addiction to smack, cocaine. The likely solution to a many of these drug-ridden peoples problems.

Why waste our 'tax payers money' on services such as Centrelink, when it could be better spent on further education for private schools, or as a pledge for a new government service to help 'discard' unwanted Labour voters. But whatever your reason, think about poorly treated conservatists (like me), who are losing the battle against a race of absolute, imprudent scum.................

"It's a general conception that Labour Party voters are general scum. When we least expect it, they'll swoop down from the highests of points and steal your money, leaving you vaunerable and weak.
