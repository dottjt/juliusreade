You're not stupid. 

Gullible, probably. Delusional? Well, obviously. 

I mean you're on this website designed for misfit derelicts, which clearly indicates that there's something very wrong with you.

Yet I don't think you're stupid.

Because as long as you have the ability to learn, you cannot possibly be stupid.

Your ability to learn is what makes you more powerful (and in a lot of cases, more irrational) than any other animal on this planet.

Which means you can achieve anything you want, assuming you play the game right. 

Stupid on the other hand has no potential. 

It has no ability, because it is not self-aware.

And we both know you're keenly aware of your limitations, which is why you're seeking answers. 

You want potential and you've come to ther right place.   

This website covers a number of techniques to help you learn a tremendous amount of information in a short amount of time. 

And an integral part of this strategy is to understand concepts from an intuitive and engaging perspective. 

Because if you can't understand everything with ease, you've already lost the game.

And I'm not even joking. 

Now let it be known, intuitive explanations only play a small part in the overall learning strategy we will be developing. 

However it is an excellent starting point for those of us new to the whole "Julius Reade lifestyle" thing I'm clearly trying to sell you. 

In a nutshell, allow me to explain the value of intuitive explanations and why you should buy them by the bucket-load. 

### What Are Effective Explanations? 

![What Are Effective Explanations? ](/img/blog/01-01.png)

Effective explanations are comparable to compelling narratives. 

They are exciting, logical stories which provide us with obvious hints and cues to help us understand any situation.

Doesn't sound familiar? 

Quite frankly most explanations are awful, which in large part is intentional by design.

I won't go into the intricacies and politics of why, however the point is that effective communication is a skill that needs to be embraced and cherished.

And creating a compelling narrative is arguably the most effective way to do this. 

As a helper, compelling narratives can be thought of as a timeline of getting from "I have literally no idea WHERE I am!" to the "ah-ha!" moment of intuitive and comfortable understanding.

In essence, explanations are those vital tools which help us get to our "ah-ha!" moment of self-realisation, as we now become keenly aware that we're actually trapped in a dungeon in a very SAW-like situation. 

Of course, not all explanations are made equal.

### Terrible Explanations - 01

![Terrible Explanations](/img/blog/01-02.png)

Terrible explanations, as I'm sure you're aware, get us absolutely nowhere. 

Like an awful film tied together on a shoe-string budget, the plot makes no sense, you're about ready to fall asleep and you still have no idea why the entire cast has been replaced by a series of talking traffic cones.

In fact, terrible explanations can even assist us to misunderstand our situation, bringing on a whole new world of pain to our lives.

Yet what makes terrible explanations so insidious is that they can seem completely rational, while actually being completely wrong and contrary to the actual situation. 

Afterall, while humans would like to consider themselve rational creatures,  our collective actions obviously speak in the opposite direction.

Deciphering between good and bad explanations is a seperate skill you will learn to decipher at another time, which becomes crucially important when selecting study material. 

For the time being, it can help to keep your mind open and not become too invested in one set beliefs or ways of thinking. 

Ultimately, as we'll discover later, so-called "incorrect" perspectives are not necessarily bad. They can often point out and help us understand more "correct" perspectives a little better. 

In essence, terrible explanations take us from "I have no idea what I'm doing" to "Why am I covered in blood?"

Not fun.

### Average Explanations - 02

![Average Explanations](/img/blog/01-03.png)

Average explanations are really no better than terrible explanations. 

Like average films, they’re entirely dull and forgettable. They take us 50% of the way there, if we're lucky, assuming we haven't already forgotten what we've watched by the next day.

Not to mention, and this is a key point on why intuitive explanations are so important, this also leaves us with the other 50% of the situation to  figure out for ourselves.

Which if you have depression, existing learning difficulties and emotional issues, is a gargantual task for even those well-attuned to the realities of life. 

Because let’s face it: When you’re depressed and are barely functioning, to expect someone to spend even 10% of their effort to try and help themselves is absurd. 

Furthermore, why spend more than 10% of the effort to learn something anyway? Energy is a limited and vital learning resource, so the less energy we can spend - the more bang we can get for our buck.

This is critical if we are to take advantage of those moments where we're too tired to do anything rigorous, but still have the energy to absorb information or complete menial tasks.

For an explanation to be effective, we need to be taken 90% to 95% of the way there, or as close as possible to full understanding as can be achieved, with as many possible cues and hints as possible.

The more the better. One key learning strategy we will discover is to present the same information in a number of different ways, so that we can have a more holisitic, and therefore more in-depth understanding of knowledge.

### Intuitive Explanations - 03

![Intuitive Explanations](/img/blog/01-04.png)

This is where intuitive explanations fit in.

Intuitive explanations are like timeless movies. They are beautiful and provide us with convincing narratives to help us better understand who we are.

Intuitive explanations are designed to take us 90% of the way there and more.

They are designed to be so simple and obvious, that absolutely anyone can internalise them and come to a level of functional understanding.

If you're not getting it, then I promise it's not your fault.

It means either you need to use a different explanation or you need to break the explanation down into smaller, more logical steps for your mind to consume.

The smaller and more logical you can make the steps, the more obvious and intuitive you can allow the explanation to become.

Of course, in the overall scheme of things, there are also other factors to consider - in particular the expectations we set for ourselves when learning  new subjects.

### Help You

![Helping Yourself](/img/blog/01-05.png)


Even though intuitive explanations can take you 90%, perhaps even 99% of the way there, you still need to find the effort to do the rest. 

This is often easier said than done and like anything in life, there are no guarantees, only statistical probabilities. 

Never-the-less, by following a proven process we can dramatically minimise these statistical probabilities so that we are in-control of our own lives.

It's like the process the army uses to train recruits. It largely works, because it's a tested process that produces consistent results.

Only with intuition can we easily grasp the things which at first seem impossible: Like our depression, for example. 

I suppose the insurmountable takeaway from all this is that if you’re struggling with trying to understand anything in life, question the line or reasoning (the explanation) you're relying on.

When does the explanation stop making sense? Is it because I lack domain knowledge? Is it because it's the first time I'm learning this particular concept and I'm naturally uninformed? 

Doing this kind of thinking can help us better understand the learning process, and help us become more efficient with our learning. 

Intuitive explanations are mostly important when starting out with difficult and dense concepts, such as undergraduate mathematics. 

Well, that's all folks. Please let me know what you think in the comments section below.

Be that guy. Go on.
