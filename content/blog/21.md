In a lot of ways you could say that Amelia was merely a figment of my imagination.

Well, her imagination. 

Ultimately, that will be for you to decide. 

Certainly, Amelia wasn't her real name. 

Not that it ever bothered anyone, as I'm sure you'll come to understand. 

It's hard to explain, however it's as if she would put you under some sort of elaborate spell.

(although it could just be my imagination)

And part of it had to do with the fact that Amelia was special. 

(she'd probably punch you if you told her that, but there was no denying that in my imagination, she was special)

I suppose the difficult thing about being special is that it's something out of your control.

Which is to say that 'special' is a perception that one has of others. 

Rather than something you actually are.

And I imagine (again) that she merely wanted to be normal.

Which I'm sure happened under some circumstances.

However, I would also argue that almost everyone has an imagination. 

So I find it difficult to believe that most people treated her as if she were a normal person. 

Again, I would like to remind you that this could just be my imagination at play. 

So let's explore the dissasociation for a tiny moment.

And view the derangement from up-close. 

Part of me thinks it was because she embodied everything us young guys wanted. 

That broken goddess of sex, lust and mental illness. 

(as it turns out, us men are somewhat... unsettled creatures)

Which is also to say that Amelia was the imagination of man.

That image of sex and grandeur we've all been brought up to worship and devour. 

And as said goddess, she was that perfect gateway to all those awful aspects of our personality.

The personality of man. 

Of course, the world of imagination obscures in the worst of ways. 

And of those she touched, she suffered much more greatly than anyone else.  

For she was the character she could not bear. 

Perhaps, because she knew it wouldn't make a difference. 

### The Details. 

![The Details.](/img/blog/21-01.png)

How would I describe Amelia? 

Well, as Amelia was merely an extension of my imagination.

That would involve describing myself.

I'm 20 years old. 

I discover this thing called Tumblr and I realise that I can use it as a platform to find women.

Which I thought was pretty cool, provided I'd never actually kissed, nor even gotten close to one in my entire life. 

I viewed it as a challenge, something new and exciting in my life. 

For the uninitiated, Tumblr is a blogging site with a very dark personality.

Almost everyone on Tumblr has issues, whether they realise it or not. 

In my case, it was due to my insecurity and complete deprivation of women. 

And part of me thought it made sense to pursue women with mental health issues, as I also had mental health issues myself. 

HA. 

Anyway, messaging as many girls as I could find in Melbourne. 

I eventually meet Amelia.

And like most girls, I became hopelessly obsessed. 

"Sex and drugs".

Wait, what? 

"Sex and drugs. There's no catch." 

I remember feeling hopelessly giddy at the time, as if I'd discovered some kind of gold mine.

She was articulate. Intelligent. 

I don't think I found her very attractive at the time, however my imagination tells me otherwise. 

Mainly, she was the first girl to say yes. 

Because up until then, I experienced nothing but complete friction with women. 

(and I don't blame them, I was a bit of a dick)

So we decided to meet up. 

Walking from my home, I found her at the train station reading a book. 

I believe it was a book of Plato, (it was either Plato or Aristotle), and I noticed she was rapidly flicking through the pages. 

She was incredibly shy and nervous, and she revealed it was because she was autistic.

And piece by piece, the picture was drawn.

She was obsessed with physics and astronomy. 

She had photographic memory, and could draw out entire constellations from memory. 

She revealed that she had a rare disease, and that she most likely wouldn't live beyond the age of 21.

She claimed to have scored the single highest academic score within her state.

She was a minimalist, and liked to throw everything away.

She was violently raped, and had a very serious stalker.

She was tough.

Cherry was her favourite fruit.

And her breasts. 

G's. 

Yes. 

For I am a man.

And you are witnessing my imagination. 

### The Night. 

![Why Is Compassion So Hard?](/img/blog/21-02.png)

I suppose you could call it a special night for me. 

I experienced my first kiss. 

I lost my virginity. 

I mean, I could barely get it hard enough to go in, and she was definitely faking it.  

At one point she literally blacked out mid-sex. 

(she said it was medical, but I feel like it was anxiety)

However she was my first. 

So it was undoubtably special.

Now, there's very good reason why I keep referring back to my imagination. 

Because I don't think she wanted to have sex with me that night. 

In fact I know she didn't, because she told me days later. 

When she broke down on the tram and confessed to a stranger.

She told me that she just wanted to hang out, and nothing more. 

I remember feeling genuinely shocked at the time. 

Maybe I'd pressured her into it. Maybe she was too shy to say no. Maybe I was too naive to know otherwise.

I mean, in my mind I was under the impression that she was all about sex and drugs.

But perhaps that didn't mean sex and drugs with me. 

After all, she'd already slept with a heap of other guys recently. 

So I thought I was okay too, you know. 

On another level, I felt like there was something much deeper going on.

Perhaps she was doing it to prove some aspect of her personality.

Maybe it was the power she was looking for. To feel as if she was in-control of her reality.

<!-- 
Then again, maybe there was something innocent about a naive guy like me.

And she liked the fact that I was willing to believe anything. 

-->

Of course, this is all in retrospect. 

I have no bloody idea. 

Regardless, we still remainded friends and we continued to chat online.

Although, certainly not without it's ups and downs. 

I remember we decided to meet up a few more times, and it was... I don't know.

It was weird.

I mean, not because of the sex, but because it was always weird. 

For starters, she was autistic.

We would sort of sit there and she wouldn't say much. In addition, we had very little in common.

Yet at the same time, I think we were fond of each other. 

There was something about it that was safe and innocent, even though it may have been incredibly dull at times. 

I remember we'd always be super keen to meet up when the opportunity arose every few months.

Yet when we did, it was always very anti-climatic. 

We were friends without being friends at all.

I think at this point, I realised that the only reason why I liked her was because she was special.

I was obsessed with this idea of Amelia. 

Someone who was smart, sexy and independent. 

And in my mind, there was power in that. 

On the contrary, she probably thought my complete and utter ignorance was cute.

And in a sense, I think we both misunderstood each other equally. 

And at that point, I guess I became the role of the journalist in her life. 

She would tell me about all the things in her life.

The abusive relationships, the medical conundrums etc.

A lot of which I don't feel comfort writing about.

Largely because I don't have all the details down pat. 

So I'll leave it there.

### The Lesson. 

![The Lesson.](/img/blog/21-03.png)

I wasn't too sure how to write this chapter. 

Initially I was going to write about how she convinced me to believe in magic. 

But I think there's greater meaning to be had from this article. 

Largely, I want to write about how she influenced me as a person.

As well as the lessons learnt from her being in my life. 

In many ways, Amelia was an extension of my own insecurities. 

Mostly, wanting to feel special. 

It's the only reason why I put up with her, because it made me feel as if I was in on something cool. 

I've now come to realise how destructive this is. 

And I guess you could say that I've come to accept myself for who I am. 

That is, your average, hard-working joe.

Who sure, has been traumatised a little here and there. 

But is still largely confined to the laws of nature. 

I've come to understand that I'm hardly special. 

However instead, that I'm a capable, decent human being who has a lot to look forward to in life. 

Someone who focuses on all the positive and enabling attributes that hold me together. 

Rather than in doubt at the fact that I don't have a monster cock. 

However I think the reason why I've managed to overcome a lot of my mental health issues.

Is because I'm living life to my fullest and to the best of my ability. 

I consistently work out. 

I spend most of my spare time writing, creating and learning new things. 

I'm doing absolutely everything I can in my power to be amazing in some way or another. 

And that's the standard I hold myself to. 

And it's really paying off. 

I'm seeing amazing results in my life and sure, part of me desires to be 'special' and unique. 

But I'm successfully suppressing that.

Leaving Amelia behind has been key to this.

Allowing me to accept myself for who I am. 

### Liar. 

![Liar.](/img/blog/21-04.png)

If you haven't quite noticed yet. 

Amelia was also a liar.

Not entirely, but enough to be branded one. 

Some people were smart enough to catch on. 

Personally speaking, I was too far obsessed with what I wanted to believe. 

Partly because I was stuck within that journalist mindset. 

I merely wanted to surround myself amongst a host of destructive and interesting characters. 

So I could feel as if I was worth something. 

Certainly, there was some kind of very deep intention that was never revealed. 

Some intricate part of her character that she ultimately kept secret. 

And that she would never let anyone touch. 

For example, I do genuinely believe she was autistic. 

And I do believe that she was chronically ill (I believe she even developed cancer at one stage). 

However, I would say a lot of the lying had more to do with her being shy and wanting to fit in.

Which is to say that a lot of her actions were motivated by the wrong things.

Which was her own battle to fight. 

Though perhaps that's why we liked each other. 

On some level we both knew we were utterly clueless, and yet we couldn't quite see it from within ourselves. 

If I had to genuinely describe Amelia, I would say she was a lot like Electra Heart from Marina and the Diamond's second album.

She sort of even looked like her, and they both had Greek heritage.

So go figure. 

I think it's ironic because Marina created Electra Heart to signify, in her words: "the antithesis of everything that I stand for".

And yet Amelia conveyed all those awful things so perfectly. 

Of course, because it's the illusive fantasy almost none of us can resist. 

Certainly, none other than man himself. 

### The Details. 

![Why Is Compassion So Hard?](/img/blog/21-05.png)

I suppose there are a few reasons why we no longer talk anymore.

For starters, her highly sexual natural triggers me.

And I've come to value my mental health waaayyyyyy too much. 

She would constantly post on her Snapchat about getting ready for threesomes.

And as a guy with severe pornography addiction and sexual adequacy issues. 

It just wasn't for me.  

Secondly, I've come to realise that I don't need an Amelia in my life.

I don't need a godess to glorify or imagine.

To feel as if I'm worth something. 

I've come to realise that I too can be sexy, smart and alluring.

That I can be the Amelia Snow I've always wanted to be.

I think part of what made her 'special' was in my complete willingness to believe. 

Not in myself, but in her. 

And as a result, I viewed her as this holy grail of happiness and desire.

When I knew she was not those things on the inside. 

And as much as my male brain refuses to believe it, sex doesn't make you happy.

Rather, I've come to let go of my imagination.

And to embrace reality for what is.

So goodbye, Amelia Snow. 

And hello, Julius Reade. 

<!-- 




I remember it being very cold outside, but we got chatting soon enough. 

She was reading aristotle 

She told me that she had 


And obviously, this is where things begin to breakdown. 

Very broken, very smart and very traumatised.

very talented, very, very desired. 



Let's just say, that she had enormous breasts. 

She was desired. 

She was short and pudgy. 

She arranged to meet me at my house, which is where we met at the train station for the very first time. 

She was reading aristotle, which is where she revealed she had high-functioning autism. 

I remember she was flicking through the pages of her book quite rapidly.

She said she could read pages within seconds, and that she had photographic memory. 

She was interested in physics and astrology, and later went on to study these things at University.

At one point she described physically mapping out all the stars in the visible universe onto paper. 

I found it quite amazing. 

There were a few other details I would discover that night. 

She revealed that she was terminally ill, and that she most likely wouldn't live beyond 21. 

She was 19 at the time. 

She also claimed to have had an obsessive rapist. 

In fact, she was originally from Queensland and was staying at her nonna's house (yep, she was Italian), along with her father. 

She was living in the garage downstairs.


There's something about mystery that captivates you.

I suppose that's why I became so obsessed with the break up of my first relationship. 

There were so many unanswered questions that I felt almost paralysed. 


I remember telling her that I would write a book about her oneday. 

Well, that's absurd now and I'm not quite as enamoured as I used to be. 

In a lot of ways, it was a sad time in my life - a period I never want to revisit. 

However, what I've discovered in all this is that I don't need an Amelia in my life. 





Which I still find hilarious, given she even met my mother at one point. 

She said she was interested in renting a room at my parent's place.


No one ever truly knew why, and part of you knew that, but then that was why you also wanted to know her. 

To discover the mystery. 

I suppose that was part of her charm - there was something infinitely elusive about her. 

Something magical in the way she acted, as if you were in special company.

As if she were playing some kind of elaborate character.

A hoax?

Assuming she wasn't lying, then she is most likely dead. 

However there is also a chance she could be alive, so it's anyone's guess. 

What made Amelia so interesting is that she would reveal 90% of her life to you, the nitty gritty of her condition.

Yet you would still feel as if you never truly knew her. 

It's like you met all the people in her life, you saw what was going on - yet none of it felt real.

I suppose I'm writing this today to tell you the story of Amelia Snow. 

At least the version of Amelia that I experienced.

I told her I would one day, so here I am in that very day. 

I still don't quite know which aspects of her story are true, nor which were untrue.

So I'm just going to paint the picture as I remember it.

Because the picture is what she wanted you to have. 

Or perhaps I was self-seeking in my desires. 

Hell, I think we all were. 







Of course, I still wonder how much of it was my imagination - making assumptions about the world as if glitter were gold. 

Am I just making this up? 


Because while we idealise the world as this pool of dopamine.

In reality, humans can only take so much. 

But no. Men always want more. 




There was something destructive about my relationship with Amelia.

Largely because all the relationships I had on Tumblr were destructive in some way or another.

(well, except for my current girlfriend, whom I've been together with for approximately 3 years now)

For example, Amelia convinced me to believe in magic. 

Fairies, imps etc. 

I mean, not that believing in magic is a destructive thing.

It was just that level of influence. 

Firstly, it was something she personally believed in. 

She went into detail about how it worked.

Describing her family history, as well as the lore behind it. 

She would tell the most fascinating stories of the most odd encounters. 

I remember she was too shy to tell me at first, afraid I would judge her as being crazy. 

I suppose this tied in with the strong theme of death in her life. 

She would always describe the ways in which she's tried to kill herself. 

And yet would never succeed, in part due to who she was. 

She would play with redback spiders and not get bitten. 

I suppose I found it fascinating. 

Then of course, I experienced it first hand.

She was over at my house and it was getting late. 

She insisted that she sleep on the cold hardwood floors, with nothing but a pillow.

Even though it was the middle of Winter. 

Of course, she insisted. 

Anyway, a few minutes pass and she angrily tells me to stop it.

Naturally I start giggling.

I mean, I'm just lying in bed sleeping, and I have no idea what she's on about.

She says it's because I threw something at her. 

Anyway, I hear a thud and she gets real angry this time. 

Mind you, she's on the floor, literally shivering to death. 

Eventually I convince her to come join me in my single bed. 

Later she described of a creature that lives in your house and causes havoc. 

Something like a goblin, but I don't quite remember it's name. 

Of course, she could have just been throwing her own phone at herself. 

But again, I didn't mind believing. 

It was my own little fantasy world and I liked that. 

The only thing I hated was that you had to 'be of blood' to truly witness these things.

And naturally I wasn't. 

I suppose part of the insecurity and attachment to Amelia was this idea that I couldn't be her. 

I couldn't have sex with her. 

I couldn't understand her.

And that made me feel as if I weren't good enough. 

Which made me want her more.
