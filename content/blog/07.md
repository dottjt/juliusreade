Firstly, I would like to say that I'm impartial to those who obsess over pick up.

People do things for all sorts of reasons and I have no purpose to judge their intentions.

I guess I want to reflect on my own experience, because I think it reveals a lot as to why people do it.

About the unfortunate circumstances that lead to pick up. Perhaps, to prevent future generations from pursing it. 

Because for some people, it's a necessity where the alternatives are much worse, or perhaps where there are no alternatives. 

On a more personal level, I also believe pick up has a lot to teach us about success, in particular how to build confidence and treat women with more respect.

Wait a second. 

Treat women with respect?

...or perhaps from a different angle, respect ourselves enough not to be insecure assholes. 

Certainly, if it weren't for studying pick up I would be a much more dysfunctional person than I am today. 


Now admittedly, a lot of pick up is ugly. 

A lot of people end up getting hurt on both sides and it's entirely unavoidable.

So let's talk about it, rather than dismiss or demonise it. 

Because I can assure you that most of us aren't predators, trying to become some kind of playboy magnet.

Though they certainly exist and it's something most of us have idealised.

The reality is much more... inconsiderate.  

Most of us are insecure, confused, socially-awkward, somewhat broken men trying to figure out women.

In fact, not even women. 

We don't know how to connect with people.

This includes are friends, our parents, our loved ones, and it's terrible.

### Why I Resorted To Pick Up 

![Why Do We Say Sorry?](/img/blog/07-01.png)

This is going to sound terrifying, however pick up literature more-or-less taught me everything positive I know about women. 

Let's talk about why. 

Firstly, I hated people.

I was a cynic, I thought society was bullshit, I thought everyone was fake, and this extended particularly well to women. 

I never melded well into groups of any sort, and that certainly meant girls were out of the picture. 

So through-out primary school into high school, I was basically this angry, socially-incapable, unapproachable blob of a human being. 

I didn't know any women, I went to single-sex schools where my friends didn't know any women and that was that. 

But that was okay.

Because I was also under the impression that women and relationships were horrible.

This largely has to do with my own family. 

I didn't grow up with a loving, happy family. 

My parents split when I was eight years old, and even when they were together, they would constantly fight. 

I even remember telling them as a child that I never ever wanted to be in a relationship, because of how horrible it was. 

To which they would smile and brush me off. 

What made my impression of women worse was my mother - this irrational pit of dysfunction that would attract questionable men.

In particular, drunken, abusive men who loved to argue.

In fact, I've now come to realise that argument is how my mother primarily communicates with others - precisely through lack of communication. 

What was worse was that it was always somewhat transactional, always as a ploy to gain something from someone. 

I didn't grow up with strong, sensible female role models. 

And as the only female role model in my life, I thought if all women were like my mother, then why bother? 

Once you go through a few dozen dysfunctional boyfriends and pseudo step-fathers, in addition to the further fighting and drunken disorderness, you can imagine why I grew up very jaded.

Not to mention, my idea of what a relationship was revolved around transaction, because that's largely how my mother seemed to interact with men.

It wasn't about love or care. 

It was about what you could provide, largely in the form of money.

Even my own relationship with my mother was largely transactional.

We very rarely talked, let alone hugged or any of that stuff normal families do.

Instead, she sold it as something normal, as something almost to be proud about. 

And of course, she wasn't the only one. Almost everyone in my life was dysfunctional, but that's just how it was. 

In the hopelessness that pursued, I turned to pornography where I got to live out my ideal fantasy of what relationships were:

Full of dopamine. 

Of course, it was merely a distraction, but at least it was something to hold onto. 

### What Pick Up Taught Me

![What Pick Up Taught Me](/img/blog/07-02.png)

Like anything, there's good pick up literature and there's bad pick up literature. 

Most people start off with the soul-destroying pick up that is marketed well, only to discover the true gems when it's too late.

Initially, pick up taught me that women were dumb fuck-things. 

That if you played "the game" well enough, you could get anyone you want. 

Of course, that's the horrible, highly-marketed pick up that most people start out with.

In fact, the most popular book at the time was entitled "the game" by Neil Strauss, which I'm sure most guys have read at some point in their lives. 

Part of the reason why it was terrible was that it didn't work and a large part of that is that it didn't teach you how to be confident. 

Of course, the other part of the problem is that men are often driven by sex. 

Like a lot of popular literature, it merely sold the ideals and fantasies of being a playboy. 

Then there's good pick up advice.

What makes it unique is that it has absolutely nothing to do with pick up.



Good pick up advice focuses on how to develop self-confidence on personal level and how to be a strong, confident individual. 

Good pick up advice has absolutely nothing to do with how to attract and manipulate women, but understand women.

Shit pick up advice on the other hand is about dating and how to make your next move.



Looking back, I think the main thing I struggled with was this idea of what it means to be a man. 

I had no real positive male figures in my life, so I didn't really 





When you think about it, the only real place left to understand women was from books.

I didn't know any women and , so it was a distant starting point for me. 

Now there's a wide range of pick up literature and 

Thankfully I didn't want to remain angry and cynical. 

The next best thing was learning about women from books. 



those who had experience with it.


I didn't want to let go of this dream of becoming a better person, of breaking the cycle.

The scary thing is that usually these attempts merely reinforce the cycle.

However maybe I got lucky. 

### What Pick Up Taught Me

Before I explain how a lot of pick up advice is terrible and harmful, I want to expose what good pick up is about. 

The problem with this advice is arguably not the advice, but the kind of women that it works on. 

It's advice that only works on insecure women. 






### There's No Substitute

![There's No Substitute](/img/blog/07-04.png)

There are two types of fools in this world. 

There are those who try to escape reality by distracting themselves with menial pleasures, such as television and video games. 

It is a kind of surreal adoption of passivisty towards life, where there is no urgency or drive. 

In the other corner, are those who are so fearful and insecure that they have this intense need to pursue reality.

To change, aspire and explode. 

I happen to fall into the second category, as do most other people who pursue pick up artistry. 


Men so insecure that we feel like we need to study this stuff. 







There's a lot of misconception. 

The reason there's no point try





In particular, I want us to focus on this idea of victim and what it actually means to be a victim. 

Because when you dig down deeper, it's a silly, self-perpetuating notion that provides no utility in trying to understand who we are. 

It's like trying to pick a victim between two countries at war. It merely adds fuel to the fire. 




### End Game

Ultimately, I believe most ambitious young men will get involved with pick up literature to some extent.
