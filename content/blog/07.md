Men are insecure, hollow creatures. 

You know, a lot like women.

eh.

Firstly, I want to say that I'm impartial to those who obsess over the art of picking up women.

People do things for all sorts of reasons, and I have no real purpose or right to judge their intentions.

I personally think it has a lot that it can teach us about success, in particular how to build confidence and treat women with more respect.

And certainly, I would argue that if it weren't for studying pick up, I would be a much more dysfunctional person than I am today. 

I guess I wanted to write this piece because I believe there's a lot to be said about men who pursue pick up artistry.

Not about women, but about the unfortunate circumstances that lead men to do this. 

Most of us aren't predators, trying to become some kind of playboy magnet (though I'm sure it's something most men have idealised).

Rather, we are insecure, confused, somewhat broken men trying to figure out our broken lives. 

Admittedly, a lot of pick up is ugly. Admittedly, a lot of people end up getting hurt. 

Arguably, it's entirely unavoidable, so let's talk about it, rather than dismiss or demonise it. 

In particular, I want us to focus on this idea of victim and what it actually means to be a victim. 

Because when you dig down deeper, it's a silly, self-perpetuating notion that provides no utility in trying to understand who we are. 

It's like trying to pick a victim between two countries at war. It merely adds fuel to the fire. 

### Why I Resorted To Pick Up 

![Why Do We Say Sorry?](/img/blog/05-01.png)

Pick up literature more-or-less taught me everything I know about women. 

While this may sound terrifying, let me tell you about my life before pick up.

Because I promise it's much, much worse.  

Firstly, I didn't grow up with any exposure to dating or women. 

In primary school not a single girl even hinted at wanting to fuck me and throughout high-school I'd always attended single-sex schools, surrounded by academic prudes. 

I didn't know any women, my friends didn't know any women, and throw in the fact that I was incredibly awkward in-front of women, and I had no chance to survive out there. 

In fact, part of this had to do with the fact that I hated women.

Which leads me to my second point: I was under the impression that women and relationships were horrible.

This largely has to do with my own family. 

My parents split when I was eight years old, and when they were together, they were constantly fighting. 

I even remember telling them as a child that I never ever wanted to be in a relationship, because of how horrible it was. 

I believe my mother told me that despite the dysfunction, "it was worth it". 

My hate for women grew as an extension of my mother - an irrational pit of despair and the sole (and female) role model in my life. 

I thought if all women are like my mother, then it's probably easier if I just killed myself. 

Not to mention, the number of dysfunctional boyfriends and pseudo step-fathers  which lead to further fighting, drunken disorderness and a horrible taste of regret in my mouth.

Certainly, I grew up very, very jaded.

My idea of what a relationship was revolved around transaction, because that's largely how my mother seemed to interact.

It wasn't about love or care. It was about what you could provide, and it's unfortunately corrupted my mindset to this day.

I didn't even really have a proper relationship with my own mother. It was entirely transactional. 

We very rarely talked, let alone hugged or any of that stuff normal families do.

I still remember being completely shocked, at the age of 21, having dinner with my second girlfriend's family and realising: "Holy shit, this is actually what a functioning, happy family is about".

I think part of the issue is that my mother always sold to me that life was about fighting and puttting up with dickhead. 

She sold it as something normal, as something almost to be proud about. 

Now I just realise that she was fucked in the head. 

In the hopelessness that pursued, I turned to pornography where I got to live out my fantasy of what ideally relationships were:

A dopamine trip of addiction and self-worthlessness. 


So here I am. 

This confused lad, with literally zero idea of how to approach women, let alone any healthy or concise idea of what a relationship even was. 

And the next best thing was learning about women from those who had experience with it.

I mean, what choice did I honestly fucking have? 

I didn't want to let go of this dream of becoming a better person, of breaking the cycle.

The scary thing is that usually these attempts merely reinforce the cycle.

However maybe I got lucky. 

### What Pick Up Taught Me

![What Pick Up Taught Me](/img/blog/05-01.png)

Like anything, there's good pick up literature and there's bad pick up literature. 

Most people start off with the soul-destroying pick up that is marketed well, only to discover the true gems when it's too late.

Before I explain how a lot of pick up advice is terrible and harmful, I want to expose what good pick up is about. 

Good pick up advice focuses on how to develop self-confidence on personal level and how to be a strong, confident individual. 

Good pick up advice has absolutely nothing to do with how to attract and manipulate women, but understand women.

Shit pick up advice on the other hand is about dating and how to make your next move.

The problem with this advice is arguably not the advice, but the kind of women that it works on. 

It's advice that only works on insecure women. 






### What Drives People Towards Pick Up

![Why Do We Say Sorry?](/img/blog/05-01.png)

There are two types of fools in this world. 

There are those who try to escape reality by distracting themselves with menial pleasures, such as television and video games. 

It is a kind of surreal adoption of passivisty towards life, where there is no urgency or drive. 

In the other corner, are those who are so fearful and insecure that they have this intense need to pursue reality.

To change, aspire and explode. 

I happen to fall into the second category, as do most other people who pursue pick up artistry. 


Men so insecure that we feel like we need to study this stuff. 







There's a lot of misconception. 

The reason there's no point try
