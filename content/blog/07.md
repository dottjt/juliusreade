Confidence is a wonderful thing.

If you don't take away anything from reading this article, understand that you should always live your life with confidence, no matter what you do.

An integral part of living with confidence is the feeling of confidence. 

Ultimately, confidence is a feeling and the two are inseperable.  




You have one purpose in life. 

That purpose is to make your life, as well as the lives of the people around you, feel as real as possible. 

That means playing on all the desires and insecurities of others, in order to provide them with the best possible experience in life.  

Because quite frankly, it is the only thing people care about. 

They want to feel familiar with their thoughts and surroundings. 







Maybe it's because I work in marketing background.
