The aim of this article is to help you understand your depression. 

While depression is not an easy topic to grasp, it most certainly does not need to be difficult. Rather, I believe the current difficulty people face in trying to understand their depression comes down to the lack of intuitive explanations currently out there. 

I honestly cannot emphasise how important intuitive explanations really are. Here’s how I see it:

If we think of the process of understanding as a timeline from « I have no idea what’s going on » to the « ah-ha! » moment of self-realisation, we can view explanations as tools to help us get to that « ah-ha! » moment. 

Of course, explanations aren’t everything. We too must also put in some effort to understand what the hell is going on. Explanations can only try and make it more obvious for us to latch onto. 

Terrible explanations bring us nowhere. In fact, they can even make us misunderstand what is going on, bringing a whole new world of pain to our lives. Average explanations are better. They maybe take us 50% of the way, if we’re lucky - but that leaves us with the other 50%, which if you are already depressed and have emotional issues, is practically pointless.

No. We need to be taken 90% of the way there, because let’s face it: You can barely function when you’re depressed, to expect someone to even spend 10% of their effort trying to help themselves is absurd. 

Intuitive explanations can help us get 90% of the way. 

The takeaway really is that if you’re struggling with anything in life, it’s because you don’t have an intuitive understanding of what is going on. Only with intuition can we easily grasp which seems impossible: Our depression, for example. 

Where people with depression go wrong.

Chances are that you have been a part of the hilarious dynamic that takes place between yourself and someone who is trying to understand your depression. 

« So Julius, why are you depressed? » 

In the struggle that ensues, you contemplate explaining some horrible fact about your life (which of course, you are currently trying to suppress) which prompts you to instead reply by saying « I don’t know ». Though let’s be honest, most of us just say we’re okay before escaping to the next room to avoid conversation. 

Interestingly enough however, despite how much it annoys and irritates us when others ask us why we’re sad (clearly we don’t have a damn clue), it is something we inherently do to ourselves constantly, expecting a completely different result.

Perhaps you identify it as rumination or that « self-critical » mind in your head, constantly picking apart why everything is so horrible and sad; the questions we constantly ask ourselves that we equally feel incapable of answering. 

In retrospect, part of the reason why we ruminate is that we have no idea what we’re doing. We attach onto these unfounded beliefs that we can somehow work it out logically, or that if we keep trying, we can break-through and enlighten ourselves through force. 

While asking questions is important, the biggest issue is that we tend to ask the wrong questions. Instead, I want to introduce you to a different way of thinking about our depression that fundamentally changes the types of questions we ask.

It’s quite simple and quite powerful: Instead of asking why we’re depressed, ask how we get depressed. 

While it may not seem significant, asking questions from this different point of view radically changes not only our definition of what depression is, but also how we relate to the emotions and feelings we experience.
