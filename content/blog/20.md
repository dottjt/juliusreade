I don't speak to her. 

I don't respond to her messages. 

I haven't made contact with her in over a year. 

I've done everything imaginable to keep her out of my life.

Certainly, I have no shame in my decision, even if it does occassionally trickle into guilt. 

The kind of guilt that comes with making any sort of tough decision in life. 

No different to scolding your own child or changing course into a completely different career. 

It's a decision which has positively impacted my life for the better. 

I am a happier, more functional person without her in my life.

And quite frankly, I wouldn't trade those things for the world. 

### Growing Up

![Growing Up](/img/blog/20-01.png)

How do I feel about my mother? 

Well, I feel a range of emotions. Most of them negative. 

Predominantly, I feel anger towards her.

I want to grab her face and scrape it against the wall.

And make her suffer in the same way that I did as a child. 

Which ironically, I'm sure was the same upbringing that she recieved as a child.

Of course, I intend to break the cycle.

Which is why I need to kill it at the source. 

In the Chinese way of growing up, your opinions don't matter. 

She is always right.

No matter what. 

To the point that she would dismiss me when I told her that things weren't okay. 

Even up until I was older.

Which meant there was no point in trying to understand each other. 

Nor even communicate how I feel. 

Which lent towards the development of depression and hopeless mindsets. 

Certainly, it was fair to say that our relationship was toxic. 

The only time we would ever speak was when we were fighting with one another. 

Which inherently lead to more fighting - as a false means to pretend as if we had some sort of inherent connection.

Of course, I wasn't the only one.

Fighting was the way she communicated with most people. 

Which attracted those who were either terribly submissive, or were complete assholes who enjoyed to argue and shout back.

Leading to a host of awful men sprinkled throughout my life. 

The kind of volatility that blunts you emotionally as a child.

It would be fair to say that I never actually had a real connection with my mother.

I didn't love her. I didn't think of her. 

I would only tell her that I loved her so that she wouldn't get angry at me. 

And on some level, children don't really understand love. 

And so I inherently developed this idea that love was transactional. 

With the understanding that she was my mother, and therefore I was obligated to 'love' her. 

As an act of loyalty and commitment, rather than as an actual, tangible feeling. 

Usually it's not until we experience our first relationship and actually fall in love.

Do we realise the extent to which we've been deceived.

But that's just life.

Certainly, we had nothing in common. 

We never hung out or talked about our day. 

We didn't eat dinner together. 

Hell, I even cooked my own dinner for a large portion of my life. 

Most of the time, we largely ignored each other - and it was a lot better than putting up with each other. 

It was a one-way relationship based in finance and title. 

And very little else. 

### Judgement

![Judgement](/img/blog/20-02.png)

I suppose part of me wanted to leave because I could.

I remember as a child that I would tell her that I much preferred my other friend's mother.

Because she was nicer and wasn't so judgemental.

And in response, she said that all people are nice when they have guests over. 

And that if I liked her so much, that I should run away and be her child.

Alternatively, she could have listened and tried to understand my suffering.

However that simply wasn't her style. 

Personally speaking, leaving her from my life was a sign of power for me.

Ultimately breaking that fragile system of loyalty and control which created this impression of 'relationship' in her mind. 

And of course, in my mind I knew it was all I ruse.

I knew that if I pretended to show face long enough, that it would give her the impression that I was loyal.

At least long enough until I was able to leave.  

The funny thing is that as I got older, I found myself being treated more as a stranger, rather than as her own son.

I didn't feel comfortable living in my own home.

On some level, it didn't even feel like home. That safe place where you can just... be. 

For example, the walls of my room were always empty, because I knew I was being judged.

I suppose the primary culprit was that my mother never understood the value of friendship, over the loyalty of family. 

She didn't understand that the reason why I never took up her opportunities and refused her help, was because I hated her.

She didn't understand that friendship made family strong, as opposed to the fickleness of loyalty. 

And when you hate someone, you don't care how much they're willing to help you.

You'll go as far as to let yourself rot, in order to avoid them at all costs. 

And so I rotted.

Certainly, I left my mother for one very simple reason.

She was negatively impacting my mental health. 

And I came to the realisation long ago that there is nothing more important than one's mental health. 

The aspect of her personality that impacted me most was the judgement she conveyed in everything she said.

Everything she uttered was carefully crafted back-handed comment or criticism.

It was never 'Oh, you did a wonderful job'.

It was always 'Oh, that's really great, but you really should have done this instead, and why didn't you do this as well?'

That really fucks with a child. 

Never do that. 

If you do it I'll slap you. 

The worst part is that it's something I've picked up and god knows how many other lives I've ruined because of it. 

Thankfully, I've gotten a lot better and I've changed my language to be more neutral. 

And to stop the mode of judgement dictating my thoughts. 

Now you understand how people develop low self-esteem. 

Naturally, it meant I wanted to avoid her at all costs. 

I would always murmur whenever she asked me what was going on in my life. 

I would never tell her how I actually feel. 

I was scared and afraid of her judgement.

Instead, I learnt to bottle how I feel, and distract myself with video games and pornography.

I didn't grow up understanding my emotions, because I never learnt to express them. 

Ultimately, she was a dictator. 

In fact, I felt like it was part of the reason why she split with my father (aside from the fact that he was also a deadbeat).

She wanted full control over me so she could raise me 'her' way.

Even as a child she would tell me that her time was inherently more important than hers. 

That's why I hate her. 

### Breaking Point

![Breaking Point](/img/blog/20-03.png)

Allow me to try and describe the circumstances leading up to leaving. 

I was 23.

And it was like the cold war. 

The relationship with my mother couldn't have been worse.

At this point, we were living at opposite ends of the house.

And we would avoid each other to the point that we wouldn't see each other for days, if not much longer. 

My entire life revolved around avoiding her. 

I remember I would cook this stew that would last me 2 weeks.

Just so I could stay out of the kitchen, which was situated in the middle of the house. 

She would always criticise me for not cleaning the kitchen up to her standard.

So rather than deal with her constant criticism.

(and honestly, it didn't matter how much I cleaned, she would always find something wrong)

I decided to let myself rot, and just deal with eating stew every single day. 

Later I was forced to move upstairs, where I was no longer allowed to use the kitchen.

Instead, I was provided with two hot plates and a fridge that didn't work, which lead frequently lead to food poisoning.

Of course, it gets worse. 

To further complicate the situation, I had a girlfriend who she didn't like. 

I imagine because she was fat.

(in a side conversation, she told me that she would look even uglier as she aged, due to the effects of gravity on all the fat rolls on her body)

So much so that she eventually decided to ban her from the house.

Instead, I think my mother had a different idea for my life.

She wanted me to travel and explore the world, as well as find a rich, Jewish woman (as she famously claimed).

At one point, she even wanted my girlfriend to pay $50 rent for staying in my room over the weekends.

On top of the current rent I was paying. 

It was just a clusterfuck. 

Part of it was that she felt disrespected.

Which is always going to be the case when your idea of respect is based on certain expectations of how one should live their life.

Of course, she couldn't understand that respect is something you create and nurture out of friendship.

Rather than something you demand from someone. 

Of course, there was also a fear of leaving. 

Part of it was money.

The idea of spending most my money towards rent and bills terrified me. 

And I didn't have any other friends who wanted to move out - so I felt stuck. 

So instead, it was something I'd slowly been planning out for a while. 

I'd buy items here and there on the cheap, and hide them within my room. 

Eventually I found a friend who was happy to move out with my girlfriend.

And on the night before leaving, I gathered all my things and brought them downstairs. 

Initially my mother was confused. 

Then shocked. 

Then she knew that she had fucked up. 

By then, she knew it was far too late for her to do anything.

The panic was real. 

### Future Generations

![Future Generations](/img/blog/20-04.png)

Recently I was reading through some old journals, which would detail the agony of her prescence.

She would frequently travel to china for work.

And I would write how her lack of presence was like bliss pure bliss.

I didn't have to deal with my mother and I was happy.

Another crucial reason why I decided to leave was that I wanted to break the cycle.

Under no circumstances do I want my children to be exposed to that kind of emotional neglect.

And it's part of the reason why I'm with my girlfriend, because I know she will make a wonderful mother.

Ultimately, I want to create a household without judgement. 

I want everyone to be able to express themselves and tell each other how they feel without judgement.

And I believe a strong part of this will involve teaching them how to express themselves healthily.

As such, I want to introduce ideas such as meditation early. 

As well as teach them strong life values, not by forcing them - but by demonstrating through self-example.

I remember my father telling me that I should never give up in life. 

Which I really took to heart as a kid.

Of course, he then proceeded to give up on something serious a few hours later - which sent mixed messages. 

I don't want to be that guy.

For example, I want to do homework with them. I want us all to sit at the dinner table together and work on something. 

To demonstrate that we all have a shared responsibility to our personal development. 

That was perhaps the worst thing about my mother - she would preach what she wasn't willing to do herself. 

On a side note, I always find it weird when I go to other people's family dinners.

Because everyone is always so organic and inviting, and it's always a huge culture shock for me.

In a positive way. 

I mean, it's never perfect, but there is no malice or hate.

Everyone just gets along and can speak their mind and be themselves. 

That's what I hope for my own family. 

### Moving On

![Moving On](/img/blog/20-05.png)

These kinds of situations are always interesting to think about in retrospect. 

For it's only once you're away from the danger that you begin to question why you did it in the first place. 

Largely, because you forget how awful it was, and you think that maybe with enough time. 

Things will different. 

And the reality is, it almost never is - which is probably why I will never speak to her again. 

There simply is no point. 

After all, we never really had much at all to begin with at all.

It was all a lie that I felt obliged carry.

I mean, what's a kid to do? 

Live on the streets and be homeless? Sometimes you just don't have a choice. 

I suppose the hard thing is that she genuinely loves me.

However ulitmately, I made the decision long ago that I would value my mental health under all circumstances.

And if that means cutting off my family, then it will not be for nothing. 

Certainly, it was unavoidable. 

For people never forget. 

So play as you will. 


<!-- 
 

I suppose I'm writing this article to explain why I did it. 

Why I decided to leave my mother, and why I think I probably couldn't go back.

Certainly, I don't like her. 

I don't think I ever have.

I would argue that she's largely responsible for my depression.

In the way I was treated and brought up. 

We didn't communicate, at all. 

I didn't love her. 

It was an intricate system of loyalty more-than-anything, and it was churning me on the inside. 


People do things for all sorts of reasons. 

I don't think they necessarily know why they do those things, however they do them. 



This is always a tough subject. 

"It's complicated".



It's dissasociation beyond physical and mental posession. 

Of course, I'd like to think humans are merely a product of their environment.

And that you would have done the same too. 

It's like when you watch documenties about repeat offenders, in particular drug addicts. 

And in your arm chair of comfort, you watch in disbelief as you witness them relapse again and again.

Provided the number of chances and opportunities they were provided to change. 

Well, I don't blame them.

Because if you were in their exact same position, you would have done the same. 

Certainly, that's how I feel about disowning my mother. 



Disown is a very strong word. 

It's intentional dissasociation: a born trait of both killers and maniacs.

HA

I apologise. 

I'm merely glorifying it as a means to entertan today's wonderful viewer, yourself. 

We begin. 


Aside from that, she takes everything personally. She's irrational. She hides things from me.

And she thinks she's inherently more important than everyone else. 



I think that's how my step-father really helped, as the only functioning father figure in my life. 

When in doubt, I'll think about all the hard work he put into his craft. 

And that will inspire me to do the same.

The only issue is that he wasn't
