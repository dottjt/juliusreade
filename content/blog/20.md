There really is only one mental health strategy.

It's the one where you keep trying until you find something that works. 







I wouldn't quite say I'm free from mental illness, however I think I've done well. 

I would say I'm in-control most of the time, 

Often the hardest part is figuring out what you should be doing to promote your mental health.

Because you can be doing all the right things and be completely functional, only to go on a rediculous bender that seemed completely out of your hands. 








Mental health strategy is an odds game. - it’s about eliminating the number of things that trigger you, while doing more things that empower you. It’s a principle you must trust, because it works. The problem is that it works in the future, so there’s no feedback now. Trust. You need to trust it will work.
