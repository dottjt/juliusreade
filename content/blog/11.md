Maybe you're a struggle sport. 

An undefined blob of human misery, awaiting death in a slurry of shame and complete unanticipation. 

Maybe you feel unable to help yourself become successful, either due to lack of knowledge, ability or general senselessness.

That's right. 

Welcome to the human experience. 

Perhaps it's because you feel fearful or possibly even shameful of the potential outcome, producing anxiety via your own self-perception. 

Perhaps in spite of knowing what you need to do to become successful, you find ways to self-sabotage, ignore and pretend. 

Of course, these are just words to you.

The very things you fight with in your mind each and every day, as you consider going back to bed, as opposed to waking up at 5:50am to kick ass, because why the hell not. 

Well, I'm here to provide you with a way forward.

I suppose in an indirect way, to let you know that the process must neither be hard, nor difficult.

That it's all in your head, and is the reason why most people don't get far with their health, their recovery from mental illness or their success in life. 

This should be a fun and informative one. 

### Addressing the Basics 

![A Model For Success](/img/blog/11-01.png)

One of the major reasons why we struggle with success is that we fail to address the basics.

In fact, it's the only reason we struggle with success.

We don't have balance in our ambitions. We don't truly understand what we're trying to achieve. We may not even be able to envision the outcome. We not even have our physical health in order. 

Yes, if you are not eating healthily, nor getting enough exercise, you are ignoring the basics. 

Because success isn't just a goal. Some palatable bullshit you achieve and place on a platter for the world to see. 

Success is an eco-system. It's a lifestyle. It's something you maintain and improve. It's living and breathing, no different to you. 

Though more on that later. 

The story for those who struggle with success is quite typical:

Such a person will spend all their time and energy toiling away religiously in their domain, in the belief that undetermined effort will always prevail.

The kind of person that will continue doing the same meaningless tasks, even if they consciously know that it will have zero impact on their desired outcome.

Simply because they believe they're immune to all the difficulties of success, such as self-promotion. 

The kind of people who burn out after six months, become depressed and give up due to "change of mind". 

Who unrightfully believed they were impenetrable to the common pitfalls of success, cause they idiots. 

Been there. Done that. 

The amount of online blogs, YouTube channels, podcasts, you name it - where I've just run in and crashed and burned is incredible. 

Of course, I'm also here to tell you that it's okay. 

That you haven't wasted your time... essentially wasting your time. 

Because often our efforts towards success are for a greater cause than the outcome itself, whether for self-discovery or exploration. 

I mean, those were important times in your life, however now is also a different time in your life. 

It's different because you want nothing more than to crush the competition, and leave your mark on the world in the form of hefty environmental damage and a fat bank cheque worth billions. 

Like running into a small African village and taking out an entire generation of defenseless nomads, with nothing more than a machine gun and a machette - sometimes we just want to dominate. 

Well, I'm here to tell you that there is a way forward, where you can have your cake and eat it too, if you're willing to change. 

Certainly, I'm here to tell you that you don't have to be cynical and without hope. 

Because the basics are simple, which means the solutions are simple as well. 

And thankfully, this means we're going to focus on constructing a framework.

A framework for success which will be consistent, easily producible and can be widely applied to anything in life. 

Because frameworks simply work - CAUSE THAT'S WHAT A FUCKING FRAMEWORK DOES, YO'LL.

And the most important question we have to ask in regards to this framework is: 

What is success? 

### Success Is A Veriable System 

![A Model For Success](/img/blog/11-02.png)

Folks, if you've just gotten back from the break, unfortunately ol' Johnny ist dead and I think you look wonderful today. 

So upon the age old question of interpretation, what on earth is success? 

Well, I said it a lil' earlier, but let's dig a little deeper into your subconscious for a second time:

**Success is a verifiable system.** 

Nothing more. Nothing less. 

What exactly is a verifiable system?

Well, that would be the framework, you dummy. 

What this ultimately means for us is that if that we do what's required, that if we follow the framework, we will absolutely obtain our goals.

No questions asked.

To elaborate more on this idea of success as a verifiable system:

Success is a system of structured processes, that enable us to work effectively towards our goals and ambitions, to the best of our ability. 

Sounds meaningless and wanky? 

You know, like a bunch of jumbled... words? 

Let's break it down, because it's intentionally concise. 

In layman's terms, success is a process, which facilitates hard work, which facilitates to bringing you closer to your goals. 

- You follow the process. 
- The process enables hard work.
- The hard work produces results. 

Now the key point here is work, because what's important to note is that these structured processes don't actually provide you with buckets of success, straight to your door. 

What they do provide you with is the ability to work harder and better than everyone else, which is ultimately how success is born.

Here is where it gets more crucial. 

The other key point is hard, and it's an incredibly important point that needs to be addressed. 

Hard work does not mean work that is laborious or demanding.

Anyone can do demanding work, which is why it's not hard. 

What makes work hard is the value and opportunity it provides.

And is the reason why most people will struggle with their success - they fail to do what's truly hard. 

Hard is getting people to pay attention to you and working on your marketing and branding. That is truly hard. 

Hard is working on your weaknesses that you refuse to admit - the things we suck at most. 

Hard isn't spending eight hours a day producing content in the hope that SEO will bring us results.

That's easy because ANYONE can do that. 

Hell, there's content mills that charge people $3 per article. It's foolish to think that content will ever hold on it's own. 

To iterate we're merely following the basics here. 

When you don't pursue hard work, you don't follow the basics and you sabotage your success. 

We continue. 

To elaborate even further, when we generalise these ideas of process, hard work and outcomes, there are two core themes for us to focus on:

Consistency - The framework must prevent you from crashing or burning out, and assist you in functioning 100% of the time. 

Effectiveness - The framework has to be productive, and assist you in working harder, help to get closer towards your goals. 

These two aspects are ultimately what make systems verifiable, and is what we are going to focus on. 

If your framework cannot assist you in getting closer towards your goals, in addition to help you function 100% of the time, then it is not verifiable.

And if a system cannot be verified, quite simply, it does not work. 

Instead, unverifiable systems are the kinds of systems most of us dabble in. 

It's part of the reason why we end up burning out, losing interest and getting nowhere.

It's the reason we waste our time doing meaningless tasks, because we don't bother to question the faulty assumptions leading us nowhere. 

It's not because you suck. 

It's because the system or line of reasoning we've been following sucks and enbracing that has made us suck.

Hmmmmm.

### When Systems Go Astray 

![We Don't Want The System To Work](/img/blog/11-03.png)

Systems, shitty systems. 

I suppose there's a spectrum of systems, from the highly enabling to the down-right dysfunctional. 

I think ultimately there are a few generalisations we can make on what bad systems are, and how we can avoid them.

In general bad systems are usually not self-aware.

Meaning that they do not allow for reflection and self-introspection, neither to gauge our process, nor allow us to improve our process. 

Personally, I think it's by design. 

We design these systems not to be self-aware, because on some level we know they don't work, so we want to keep that hidden from ourselves. 

It's what allows us to avoid pursuing hard, meaningful work - because we're either afraid or do not have the courage to pursue our goals in an effective manner. 

Another key point and one that we very rarely think about it, is choosing goals that don't require hard work.

That is, pursuing ideas that don't have value and 



Another part of what makes a bad system is lack of routine. 

Remember that point of consistency we were talkin' bout earlier? 

Routine is what helps embed that consistency and the less routine you have, the more you leave your life to the whimsical decisions of choice. 

Quite honestly, routine is your best friend and you should spend all your time with him/her. 

Routine is important because it's what helps create habits and when you lock down habits, you spend less time thinking and more time working.

More on that in the next chapter. 

Another very key point about bad systems is that they generally lack vision or outcome.

If you don't know what the general outcome of your work will be, then you will fail. 

Verifiable systems need to be verified. 



Of course, this can be a tricky area which can tip over into becoming significantly deluded. 

We believe we have the best idea in the world, and that everyone else should think like we do. 

So much so that we ignore the reality of the idea, and merely attach to this belief in our minds as the arbiter of truth. 


By merely becoming aware of this abstraction that is a system, you're already well-ahead of most people trying to come to grips with their success. 

There are a lot of reasons why 











### Creating A Verifiable System 

![Creating A Verifiable System](/img/blog/11-04.png)

If we look back at our definition of success as a verifiable system, there's another aspect for us to consider.

This idea of structured processes. 

While systems are usually quite complex, they are ultimately comprised of processes and structures.

In layman's terms, we mean to say work and routine. 

The process is the thing we do i.e. study for one hour. 

The structure is how we organise these processes in order to produce a verifiable system i.e. study for one hour each day. 

Now there's a secret about verifiable systems which people don't talk about, and it's by design. 

And in some ways, it goes against some of the princicples I've mentioned earlier.

However highly successful verifiable systems don't need to be verified. 

Which is to say that successful verifiable systems don't need to make you think.

Because the more time you spend thinking, the less time you spend working towards your goals. 

In other words, verifiable systems minimise the need for introspection, and at the very least, negative introspection. 

That is, fix things that aren't working.

Instead, verifiable systems tend to allow you to improve processes, rather than remove or fundamentally change them.  

What I think might be helpful is if I just tell you what I do, and see what you can replicate:

Firstly, I have a lot of routine. 

I work out three times a week. I have a dedicated fun and study night. I wake up at 5:50am everyday. I use the weekend's to relax. 

Secondly, I work hard on things that matter.

I work on self-promotion on twitter. I write an article 

Thirdly, I have vision 

My partner - Love can go a very long way to keeping us in check. My future children. I think about them a lot too. 


If you'd like to know more 

Fourthly, I have cycles. 





<!-- Link to post about routine -->

All these things come together to form my own personal framework. 


If you'd like to learn more about routine, I highly recommend reading my article about full-time work and how that's an amazing starting point for developing routine.

</div>



The brilliant thing about systems is that they allow you to verify your progress.

Which is to say that there's a level of honesty involved. 


One core aspect is that they keep us honest. 

In other words, verifiable systems are designed to keep you honest - as they respond relative .  



### My Personal Verifiable System

![My Personal Verifiable System](/img/blog/11-05.png)

Now there's an interesting point to take note here. 

However I didn't really address any of the symptoms of struggling with success.

You know, like how to deal with burnout or depression or things like that which get in the way of success.

Well, here's the thing. 

When you have a verifiable system in place, you don't suffer from these things. 

You don't burn out when you have a verifiable system.  




<!-- 

Because it certainly is much worse, you eclectic piece of crap, as you barely cope with the hours of self-agony you currently recognise as living-consciousness. 


You could be reading someone else's blog and giving them page views and that's a huge no-no. 

As a certified angel of truth and arbiter of all things righteous:

I'm bloody here to help. 



I'm going to let you in on a secret. 

In fact, it's not really a secret, because you're not stupid and you know exactly what you have to do to become successful. 

You just don't do it. 

And that's what we have to address. 

The funny thing is that while you know what this secret is, that isn't to say that you're aware of what it is. 

So rather than tell you, I'm going to describe this secret in full detail so that by the end of this article, something might click in that mind of yours and you'll do just as your ambitions intended. 





Humans have a habit of dysfunctioning. 

We lie to ourselves. We deluded ourselves. We needlessly throw away opportunities - we falther. 

because a fact you have not yet accepted, because you're too distracted to truly want success. 



The system they utilise to train soldiers works.  

What makes systems so brilliant is that they're verifiable.

The problem most people face is that they fail to utilise or discover a system that works for them. 

Either they lose motivation too quickly, struggle to learn or  

But wait!

Did I say earlier that are systems veriable? 

Well yes, they do - if you continue reading.

The only issue is that the so-called 'systems' attempted weren't verifiable . 

The problem is that instead of treating success as a system, we instead treat it as this unknown foreign object. 

Ultimately, hard because they absolutely vital and necesssary for your success.

And most people are confused and afraid of being successful, which is why they avoid hard work.
