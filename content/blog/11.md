Maybe you're a struggle sport. 

An undefined blob of human misery, awaiting death in a slurry of shame and complete unanticipation. 

Maybe you feel unable to help yourself become successful, either due to lack of knowledge or ability to strive.

That's right. 

Welcome to the human experience. 

With your host, the shitty human experience co-ordinator. 

Perhaps it's because you feel fearful or possibly shameful of the potential outcome, producing anxiety via your own self-perception. 

Perhaps in spite of knowing what you need to do to become successful, you find ways to self-sabotage, ignore and pretend. 

And of course, it suddenly occurs to you that these are just words. 

The very things you fight with in your mind each and every day, as you consider not waking up at 5:50am to kick ass, because the bed just loves you more. 

Well, I'm here to provide you with a way forward.

To let you know that things don't have to continue the way they are, and that the process must neither be hard, nor difficult.

To tell you that it really is all in your head, and that while this fact doesn't lessen your experience, is also the reason why most people don't get far with their mental health, their debilitating situations in life, as well as their success. 

I think this will be a fun and informative one. 

### Addressing the Basics 

![A Model For Success](/img/blog/11-01.png)

One of the major reasons why we struggle with success is that we fail to address the basics.

In fact, it's the only reason we struggle with success.

We don't have balance in our ambitions. We don't truly understand what we're trying to achieve. We may not even be able to envision the outcome of what we want to achieve.

Hell, our physical health could be a mess. 

Yes. 

If you are not eating healthily, nor getting enough exercise, you are ignoring the basics.

And this kind of perception on what is fundamental, is where I believe most people go wrong. 

A lot of people assume the basics consist of working hard and nothing else.

Who forget in their moment of million-dollar inspiration, that burnout and depression are very real forces which can take you down within an instant. 

Who lose track of their mental and physical health, only to wind up a squirel. 

Because success isn't just a goal. 

Some palatable bullshit you achieve and place on a platter for the world to see. 

Success is an eco-system. It's a lifestyle, something you maintain and improve. It's living and breathing, no different to you. 

What they fail to understand is that hard work is born out of this eco-system, that when ignored, fails to sustain us and keep us working. 

When you abuse this eco-system, when you abuse the basics, you abuse your potential for success, and you will fall. 

Regardless, the story for those who struggle with success is typical:

They spend all their time and energy toiling away, in the belief that their undetermined effort will always prevail over strategy.

They continue doing the same meaningless tasks, over and over again, even if they consciously know  it will have zero impact on their desired outcome.

People who believe they're immune to all the challenges of success, such as self-promotion and maintaining focus and motivation over their goals. 

The kind of people who burn out after three months, become depressed and give up due to "change of mind". 

Been there. Done that. 

The amount of online blogs, YouTube channels, podcasts, you name it - where I've just run in and crashed and burned is incredible. 

Of course, I'm also here to tell you that it's okay. 

That you haven't wasted your time... essentially wasting your time. 

Because often our efforts towards success are for a greater cause than the outcome itself, whether for self-discovery or exploration. 

I mean, those were important times in your life, however now is also important for different reasons. 

It's different because you want nothing more than to crush the competition, and leave your mark on the world in the form of fat bank cheque and a conclave of irreversible environmental damage.

Like running into a small African village with nothing more than a machette and a machine gun, to take out an entire generation of defenseless nomads.

Sometimes we just want to dominate. 

Well, I'm here to tell you that there is a way forward, where you can have your cake and eat it too if you're willing to change. 

Certainly, I'm here to tell you that you don't have to be cynical and without hope. 

Because the basics are simple, which means the solutions are simple as well. 

And thankfully, this means we're going to focus on constructing a framework.

A framework for success which will be consistent, easily producible and can be widely applied to anything in life. 

Because put simply, frameworks simply work - CAUSE THAT'S WHAT A FUCKING FRAMEWORK DOES, YO'LL.

And the most important question we have to ask in regards to this framework is: 

What is success? 

### Success Is A Veriable System 

![A Model For Success](/img/blog/11-02.png)

Folks, if you've just returned from the break, unfortunately ol' Johnny ist dead and I think you look wonderful today. 

So upon the age old question of interpretation, what on earth is success? 

Well, I said it a lil' earlier, but let's dig that tiny bit deeper into your subconscious for another time:

**Success is a verifiable system.** 

Nothing more. Nothing less. 

What exactly is a verifiable system?

Well, that would be the framework, you dummy. 

What this ultimately means is that if we do and understand what's required for our success, and if we follow our framework, we can place ourselves in a position to obtain our goals.

No questions asked.

In other words: 

**Success is a system of structured processes, that enable us to work effectively towards our goals and ambitions.**

Still don't get it? 

Well, let's break it down some more: 

Success is a process, which facilitates hard work, which facilitates bringing you closer towards your goals. 

- You follow the process. 
- The process enables you to work harder.
- The hard work produces verifiable results. 

Now the key point here is work, because what's important to note is that these structured processes don't actually provide you with buckets of success, straight to your door, with no additional charges. 

Instead what it does provide you with is the ability to work harder and better than everyone else, which is ultimately how success is born.

Through the humbling constructs of time and hard work - the same constants we're all living through. 

Though here is where it gets more crucial. 

The other key point is hard (as in hard work), and it's an incredibly important point that needs to be addressed ASAP. 

No seriously, FUCKING ASAP. 

Hard work does not mean work that is laborious or demanding.

Anyone can do this so-called "hard" work, which is why it's not hard. It is merely dull and unpleasant.  

What makes hard work "hard" is the value and opportunity it creates.

In other words, anything that is equal opportunity cannot be considered hard work.  

The demonstrable struggle that people exhibit with their success, indicates that most people have been failing to do what's truly hard to obtain their success.

Let me say it again.

You have been struggling with your success because you have been avoiding hard work. 

Though please let me spell it out for you. 

Hard is working on your branding and marketing, and getting people to pay attention to you. 

Hard is working on the weaknesses which you blatantly refuse to admit.

Hard is setting the healthy and enabling expectations in your mind, so you're in-control of your emotions when the going gets tough. 

Hard isn't spending eight hours a day producing content in the hope that SEO will bring you results.

That's easy because ANYONE can do it.

Which means a large portion of people do it, and choose to fight an up-hill battle which is incredibly time-consuming to master.

Hell, there's content mills that charge people $3 per article to do this stuff, so it's foolish to think that content will ever hold on it's own. 

Ultimately, When you don't pursue hard work, you don't follow the basics and you sabotage your success. 

Yes.

Working hard is a basic. In fact, anything that meaningfully contributes towards your success can be considered basic. 

We continue. 

To elaborate even further upon this idea of the verifiable system, there are two core themes for us to focus on:

Consistency - The framework must prevent you from crashing or burning out, and assist you in functioning 100% of the time. 

Effectiveness - The framework must be productive, and assist you in working harder, to help you get closer towards your goals. 

These two aspects are ultimately what make systems verifiable, and is what we are going to focus on today. 

If your framework cannot assist you in getting closer towards your goals, in addition to help you function 100% of the time, then it is not verifiable.

And if a system cannot be verified, quite simply, it cannot not work to your advantage. 

Instead, unverifiable systems are the kinds of systems most of us dabble in. 

And is part of the reason why we end up burning out, losing interest and getting nowhere with our ambition.

It's the reason we waste our time pursing meaningless tasks, because we don't bother to question the faulty assumptions leading us nowhere. 

I mean, it's not because you suck. 

It's because the system or line of reasoning we've been following sucks, and enbracing that has made us suck.

Hmmmmm.

### When Systems Go Astray 

![We Don't Want The System To Work](/img/blog/11-03.png)

Systems, shitty systems. 

I suppose there are a spectrum of systems, from the highly enabling to the downright dysfunctional. 

I believe there are a few generalisations we can make in trying to understand what bad systems are, as well as how we can avoid them.

To begin bad systems are usually not self-aware.

Meaning that they hide details from us, or intentionally prevent us from focusing on things that are important. 

In some cases due to ignorance, however in large part by design. 

Either consciously or subconsciously, we design these systems not to be self-aware, because on some level we know they don't work or are afraid of the work that's required, so we keep these details hidden from ourselves. 

Which is often the case when we become deluded by our ideas, and how great we think they are/will be.

It's what allows us to avoid pursuing hard, meaningful work - because we're either afraid or do not have the courage to pursue our goals in an effective manner. 

On the other hand, this kind of information hiding isn't necessarily a bad thing. 

Because at the end of the day, over-thinking and worrying about the small details is counter-productive to our success.

The only cavet is that reflection and self-introspection is important when we're starting out with building these systems, in order to gauge our progress. 

Of course, the beautiful thing is that verifiable systems work - so once you do find a working configuration, you can ultimately remain as unconscious to your schedule as much as you like - the routine simply carries you through. 

Another key point, and one that we very rarely think about it, is that we can end up choosing goals or ambitions that don't require hard work.

That is, pursuing ideas that don't have value or opportunity.  

Excessive content writing can be one of them.

The other issue is that goals that don't require hard work, are also often a lot more difficult to verify.

Because ultimately all we can verify is our success, and when there's little success to be had, it can be a bit jarring and discouraging. 

Another part of what makes systems bad is lack of routine. 

Remember that point of consistency we were talkin' bout earlier? 

Routine is what helps embed that consistency and the less routine you have, the more you leave your life to chance, and less to the rational decisions in your mind.

It's what helps create habits and when you lock down habits, you spend less time thinking and more time working (hard, hopefully).

The other positive benefit of routine is that it consolidates our process of verification.

In other words, the more we can verify and experience positive results, the better it will make us feel and is part of what keeps us from burning out. 

<!-- Article on routine -->

Quite honestly, routine is your best friend and you should spend all your time with him/her/it, depending on your sexual preference. 

Another very key point about bad systems is that they generally lack vision or outcome.

If you don't know what the general outcome of your work will be, then you will fail. 

In fact, and this is quite crucial, if you don't know where you want to be, nor the processes you must take in order to get there, then you will fail. 

Your vision, at the end of the day, is what holds you together. 

It's what keeps you on track, and more importantly, hopeful of what you're trying to achieve. 

Of course, this can be a tricky area which can tip over into becoming significantly deluded. 

So much so that we ignore the reality of the idea, and merely attach to this belief in our minds as the arbiter of truth. 

This is why it's important, at least initially until you become comfortable with your system, to remain self-aware of what you are doing. 

Remember, this is verifiable system afterall. 

The beauty of verifiable systems is that once you establish them, you can stop verifiying them or at the very least, keep the verification to a minimum.

### Creating A Verifiable System 

![Creating A Verifiable System](/img/blog/11-04.png)

Now listen, a lot of this may seem scary. 

I mean, how on earth am I supposed to know where I'm going to end up?

The thing is, you don't. 

Rather, the system knows for you and it's trust in this system that's going to pull you forward. 

It's sort of like university. 

You don't really know what's going to happen or how it's going to turn out, or even what it's going to provide you with.

All you really have are the experiences and outcomes of others who have gone to university, and that is usually the basis of which we use to verify our reasoning for going. 

Afterall, you have no experience with university. 

Because at the end of the day, and I will keep repeating this, however these are the basics we are dealing with. 

If you ignore the basics, you will suffer. 

If we look back at our definition of success as a verifiable system, there's another aspect for us to consider.

This idea of structured processes. 

Structured processes are the bread and butter of our framework. 

Which in layman's terms means hard work and routine. 

In other words, consistency and effectiveness. 

Remember? 

The process is the thing we do i.e. study for one hour. 

The structure is how we organise these processes in order to produce a verifiable system i.e. study for one hour each day, depending on the schedule. 

Now as much as I could describe what these things are, I think it might be helpful is if I just tell you what I personally do, so you can get a better idea of what these ideas mean to me: 

Firstly, I have a lot of routine. 

I work out three times a week, without fail. I have a dedicated fun and study night with the girlfriend. I wake up at 5:50am everyday. I study during the same morning and evening blocks each day.

My time is more-or-less planned, though the specifics of what I do with my time aren't necessarily. I usually write my articles in the morning train-ride, and then study programming on the train-ride back home. 

I never not have something productive to do. I have lists, I have back-up lists, I have additional weekend hobbies that keep me preoccupied - I don't let myself stop. 

Secondly, I work hard on things that matter.

I work on self-promotion on twitter. I write articles. But they aren't the main things at the moment. 

Largely, I'm working hard on building my Saas application called <a href="https://learningschedule.com">Learning Schedule</a> which essentially aims to be my business, and which hopefully can broaden my sphere of influence. 

Thirdly, I have vision.

I know exactly where I want to be. Because all my actions are verifiable, I can see the impact my learning and working on my application.

Part of the reason why I'm creating Learning Schedule is so I can have a portfolio in order to become a coder, and becoming a coder is a strong part of my vision, where I see myself and who I want to become. 

While this is only a starting point, and there's so much more I hope to cover in a seperate post, I think a big part of what makes it work is planning. Everything is planned and understood. 

What I suppose makes this difficult is that this planning has come as a result of immense trial and error, which is something that requires failure. 

Funnily enough, humans tend to learn through experience, rather than what they've been told - although listening can go a long way.

If you'd like to learn more about routine, I highly recommend reading my article about full-time work and how that's an amazing starting point for developing routine.

</div>

In other words, verifiable systems are designed to keep you honest - as they respond relative .  

### Don't Only Address The Symptoms

![My Personal Verifiable System](/img/blog/11-05.png)

Now there's an interesting point to take note here. 

I didn't specifically address any of the symptoms of struggling with success.

Because here's the thing. 

When you have a verifiable system in place, these symptoms no longer become an issue.

Which is to say that verifiable systems 

You don't burn out when you have a verifiable system.  




<!-- 

Because it certainly is much worse, you eclectic piece of crap, as you barely cope with the hours of self-agony you currently recognise as living-consciousness. 


You could be reading someone else's blog and giving them page views and that's a huge no-no. 

As a certified angel of truth and arbiter of all things righteous:

I'm bloody here to help. 



I'm going to let you in on a secret. 

In fact, it's not really a secret, because you're not stupid and you know exactly what you have to do to become successful. 

You just don't do it. 

And that's what we have to address. 

The funny thing is that while you know what this secret is, that isn't to say that you're aware of what it is. 

So rather than tell you, I'm going to describe this secret in full detail so that by the end of this article, something might click in that mind of yours and you'll do just as your ambitions intended. 





Humans have a habit of dysfunctioning. 

We lie to ourselves. We deluded ourselves. We needlessly throw away opportunities - we falther. 

because a fact you have not yet accepted, because you're too distracted to truly want success. 



The system they utilise to train soldiers works.  

What makes systems so brilliant is that they're verifiable.

The problem most people face is that they fail to utilise or discover a system that works for them. 

Either they lose motivation too quickly, struggle to learn or  

But wait!

Did I say earlier that are systems veriable? 

Well yes, they do - if you continue reading.

The only issue is that the so-called 'systems' attempted weren't verifiable . 

The problem is that instead of treating success as a system, we instead treat it as this unknown foreign object. 

Ultimately, hard because they absolutely vital and necesssary for your success.

And most people are confused and afraid of being successful, which is why they avoid hard work. 





// really good points, perhaps I should add them in. 

Now there's a secret about verifiable systems which people don't talk about, and it's by design. 

And in some ways, it goes against some of the princicples I've mentioned earlier.

However highly successful verifiable systems don't need to be verified. 

Which is to say that successful verifiable systems don't need to make you think.

Because the more time you spend thinking, the less time you spend working towards your goals. 

In other words, verifiable systems minimise the need for introspection, and at the very least, negative introspection. 

That is, fix things that aren't working.

Instead, verifiable systems tend to allow you to improve processes, rather than remove or fundamentally change them.
