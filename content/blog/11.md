I hurt my hands typing too much. 

Again. 

To the point where typing felt like whipping molten lava across my fingers. 

From what I can tell, it's something that happens to me approximately three to four times each year and it's something that I'll most likely continue experiencing. 

Well, hopefully not. 

However I'm human and learning the ropes, so I imagine failure is somewhere out there on the horizon. 

While I can clearly identify what caused my hands to hurt, part of the problem in preventing it from happening is that it can happen for a variety of different reasons. 

For instance, your fingers are more prone to 'being hurt' during winter when it's cold, which requires wearing those finger-cut gloves.

Simply having your hands on the cold, aluminium exterior of this Macbook Air is enough to send them into a state of paralysis. 

On the other hand, and in this particular case, obsession was my downfall. 

Because I am the village idiot, in addition to being a huge culprit of falling into complete obsession with absolutely anything I can get my hands. 

...and so I started working on my app. 

### How It Happened. 

![How It Happened](/img/blog/10-01.png)

I'd decided I was going to attempt to build my online application for a second time.

The first time was... well, I didn't have enough knowledge to fully complete the endeavour, and so I decided to learn more fundamental things in the meantime to allow me to better comprehend the task at hand. 

The second time around however, even though I still barely knew what I was doing, got me super silly and excited. 

Which meant I was completely obsessed and all commonsense had been blocked out of my brain. 

I remember starting on the Friday and typing non-stop to get this thing functional. 

The issue was that I was building the foundation of my application with a lot of code from the original codebase which I'd become unfamiliar with, which meant things kept breaking 

It was a classic case of "just another five more minutes and I'll stop" only to find myself at midnight, wanting to continue writing code. 

From there it only got worse and by Sunday, I knew I'd fried my hands.

The funny thing is that part of me knew this was going to destroy my hands, yet I didn't care. 

Which sounds silly, but it's no different to when you get depressed and stop caring. 

Most people would call it foolish to stop caring for yourself, to prevent one’s nurture and growth, and certainly I instinctively know it’s dumb and foolish.

But when you stop caring, you don't bother to get that far in your head, because you haven't bothered, and so you neither feel foolish, nor inappropriately stupid.

I just dun care. 

And of course, I paid the price and almost everything in my life suffered.

Including the writing of this article which is long-overdue.  

### Our Precious, Precious Hands. 

![Our Preciuos Hands](/img/blog/10-02.png)

The real problem, you discover, is that almost everything in life involves using your hands.

My work, my study, my hobbies all largely involve using a keyboard to some significant extent. 

You lose options. 

You have to be incredibly sparing with each finger stroke, so not to tip over and disturb some sort of invisible balance that you don't even know exists. 

Your typing tolerance collapses, which is to say that your fingers will hurt after a certain number of keystrokes - which you inevitably surpass each day. 

Perhaps the worst side-effect is the cognitive fear you develop in regards to typing. 

You worry so much about yourself fingers that you can't actually tell if your fingers are hurting because they're truly in pain, or if it's some psychological expectation you've set in your mind. 

Which hugely impedes on your recovery. 

Yet What makes it so difficult is that even though your ability to type dimishes, your responsibilities don't go away.

You have to willingly type to get \<insert task\> done, even though you're in pain and you know it's hurting your recovery. 

And inspite of all this, I couldn't find the will to stop typing.

I felt too invested in my code. Mentally I was fine, which made my physical issues seem insignificant. 

So naturally my fingers got worse. 

### The Paradox Of Productivity 

![The Importance Of Balance](/img/blog/10-03.png)

Part of the problem, I think, are with the increasing expectations of being an adult. 

We become obsessed, because we become insecure and narrow minded. 

We genuinely believe we can viably cheat ourselves and our health, yet every single time we fall and we end up worse than we previously were. 

The key point being that we value our productivity more than our own health - which lead me a very important realisation:

**Producitivy is not an excuse to work even harder.** 

Instead, productivity ultimately should be about 


I guess I want to talk about balance. We get ahead of ourselves and we assume that we don't need it. 

I suffer, I remember how awful it is, 
t's something I forget about, which causes me to do it again and again and again. 

I have my flaws, as we all do. 


Of course, there's another issue at hand. 

I'm also incredibly sick. I have this fever and it's 





The real saving grace, was getting sick. 



### Recovering My Hands. 

![How To Recover From Hand Pain](/img/blog/10-04.png)

The one true saving grace in this situation is that I fell sick.


I can't quite tell if I ever fully recover from it. 





Please, please, please stop abusing your hands. // I am the biggest culprit. Almost everything we do involves our hands in some way, shape or form. Yet, we abuse them. I never really cared much for my hands. A day in the life of your hands. Please, please stop abusing your hands. // I am the biggest culprit.


Intro: If you aim to be highly motivated, your hands are your most important physical asset. In a sense, if your hands aren’t hurting 
Context: 
Dis:
Change: I got crippling pain my hands. Put simply I used them too much. I wrote way, way too much.I didn’t take breaks. In a sense, I did it because I was addicted. I would fear that by not typing I would be falling behind. 
Current: I spend more time reading than I do typing and that’s a good thing. 
Adv: My hands don’t hurt. Like most things in life, you don’t realise what you have until you lose it. 
Take:
