This is not a pretty piece.

Instead, I hope you will have read a stark and honest account of what it means to be a porn addict. 

Addiction is a degrading, gut-wrenching state-of-mind that captures you and spits you out in ways entirely unimaginable, leaving you silent for days in a ruckus of despair and subliminal wanting. 

It is an on-going battle that never ends, even when you think you're in-control. A state of helplessness you soon learn to accept, and disregard as a fact of life.

Some addictions are minor.

They are meaningless addictions driven by chemical reactions, and ill-opportunity. Addictions that drive the dopamine in our mind, to crave and desire. 

They are the ones that do not keep you up at night. They are vague inconveniences at best. 

Then there are addictions driven by our belief to be addicted. The belief we must feel loved. The belief we must be worthless. The belief that self-harm serves a higher purpose, despite our best intentions to logically "think it through".   

For me, pornography is one of those addictions that resides in my beliefs - perpetuated by a kind of insecurity that swiftly evades all common sense. 

It has been a cause of pain for many, least of all myself. The good news is that it's an aspect of my life I can largely dictate, and so no longer worries me quite so much. 

There's a subtle romanticisation that takes place with addiction. 

We equate it to this wistfully incomprehensible daze of wonderful illusion, akin to an almost dream state of hopelessness. 

Certainly, I am culprit to this kind of romanticisation and I think part of it is due to how addiction touches you in ways that make you vulnerable and disconfigured. 

It almost feels like a pilgrimage of sorts, a dark ritual that exposes a side to our personality which seems essential, yet hidden. 

## Why p? 

Like most teenagers growing up, I would masturbate to ponrnography.

It was equivalent to drinking soft-drink. You did it. Everyone else did it. It made you feel good. No one gave a fuck, and likely still don't. 

While it started out like that, as I grew older the habit began to develop meaning in life. 

Following high shcool, I started taking care of myself. I started reading self-help books. I was becoming aware of the low-life I was. 

I began eating paleo, working out and 



Theres


I started associating it with my depression.

Now it is symbolic. It signifies my relapse.  





Growing up I was always dysfunctional to some extent. 





Understanding it is part of the appeal of addiction and in actual fact, actual addicts like myself are somewhat masochistic in our intent. 


It's like experience some kind of grand reset. 




Arguably, most men I know are addicted to porn.

It's a widely know, accepted fact, no different to sugar or coffee addiction. It's unsaid, because it's assumed. In fact, apparently it's weird not to watch porn. 

Quite simply, it's not right.

Though I'm not here to judge and provide a meta-examiniation of the socio-political aspects of porn addiction. Instead, I want to talk about my own personal experience and struggle with pornography.

I suppose it is a topic that is  close to me because it is a habit that has persisted since childhood.

I mean, I've tried a lot of different drugs and hell, I've even managed to get over a large portion of my mental illness - so I think that's saying something.

The good news is that I can largely control my addiction if I follow a bunch of strict guidelines, though I will generally relapse to varying degrees once every month or two months. 

## Why I relapse

Addiction is always a very personal experience for most people. 

Part of my addiction comes down to the intense curiosity I have for dysfunction.

In some ways, it is a culmination of the guilt and shame we feel on a daily basis, perpetuated by a kind of hopelessness that not only ravages, but completely destroys as well. 

Certainly, my porn addiction is not something I am proud of, though at times I also see it as a reflection of some of the darker elements of my personality. 


I suppose there are two things that truly trigger me, along with a heap of preventative measures. 

The first one 

## How I prevent relapse





## What it means to refrain from porn addiction




Arguably, I don't believe that makes it anymore okay doesn't make it anymore okay. 


Perhaps a good place to start is 

Porn addiction means a lot of different things. 

To me, porn addiction means not being able to orgasm during sex. 

Porn addiction means refraining myself from all forms of sex appeal. 

Largely, it is a process of mandatory desensitization. 



Porn addiction is something I'm sure a lot of people go through (in particular, men). 

The reasons for porn addiction are quite clear. It's a primal and dopamine response. 

Porn addiction is an incredibly serious hing. 

I have a very serious porn addiction problem. 

It's a problem that has caused a lot of grief in my life. 



I believe the current difficulty people face in trying to understand their depression comes down to the lack of intuitive explanations currently available on the internet.

Certainly, I personally spent years reading self-help articles and websites to no avail. Either the advice sucked or the information was too bloody convoluted to simply stick. 

In other words, these resources were ineffective because they were unintuitive.  

So let's try and undestand why.

##You deserve an intuitive high-five \*clap\*
