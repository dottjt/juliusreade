I do not intend for this to be a pretty piece.

Instead, I hope you will read a stark and honest account of what it means to be a porn addict. 

Addiction is a degrading, somewhat sickening state-of-mind that can capture you and spit you out in ways that are entirely unimaginable, leaving you silent for days in a ruckus of despair and subliminal wanting. 

It is an on-going battle that never ends, no matter how confident you think you are you. A state of helplessness you soon learn to accept, and disregard as a fact of life.

Inevitably there exists a spectrum of addiction, that affect us in different ways.

Some addictions are minor.

They are meaningless preambles driven by chemical reactions and poor curiosity. Addictions that drive the dopamine in our mind, to crave and desire in a congo line of lust and gluttony. 

These are the kinds of addictions that do not keep us up at night. They are vague inconveniences at best, taring our image with a feint smudge of indencency. 

Then there are addictions driven by our beliefs. The belief we must feel loved. The belief that we are worthless. The belief that self-harm serves a higher purpose, despite our best intentions to logically "think it through".   

For me, pornography is one of those addictions that resides in my beliefs - perpetuated by a kind of insecurity that swiftly evades my ability to think. 

The kind of addiction that holds you down and never lets go, that screams in your face and bites and kicks and screams in the suffering that ensues. 

While I don't quite understand my pornography addiction, I've discovered enough internal patterns and processes to be able to explain the narrative that takes place.

As a result, it iss an aspect of my life I can largely dictate, and so it doesn't quite worry, nor ravage me as it once used to. 

### The Story Of The Addict 

![The Story Of How It All Began](/img/blog/02-01.png)

Like most male teenagers growing up, I would masturbate to ponrnography.

It was equivalent to drinking soft-drink. You did it. Everyone else you knew did it. It made you feel good. No one gave a fuck, and many still don't. 

Then you grow up. 

A lot of people don't grow up, but for those that do, it creates this sudden urge to change. This urge to become better, to no longer accept the self-percieved limitations of being a child. 

You start lifting weights. You develop an interest in knowledge, philosophy and self-help books. You begin pursuing your ambitions, as if nothing can stop you. 

It is a crucial period where you are trying to discover what it means to be a man. 

Well, perhaps it was just me, considering I didn't really grow up with a father. I didn't really grow up with a central, nor functional male figure in my life. So I only had to rely on myself.  

One by one you shed the aspects of your personality that hold you down. Everything changes and you become, smarter, stronger and more resilient. 

With this context in mind, pornography addiction has always been my last frontier. 

I have been able to change nearly every single aspect of my personality, except for pornography and I believe it is an important symbolism I maintain in my mind. 

Afterall, once you become 100% functional you have no where else to go. How do you become more functional than 100% functional? How can you give life more than 100% effort? 

### A Story Of Guilt 

![The Story Of How It All Began](/img/blog/02-02.png)

I have a lot of issues.

I ultimately.

I'm a bit of guilt baby.

I have largely come 

I believe part of the reason why I relapse is due to the fluctations in time and effort that take place. 




### Maintaining Non-addiction




There's a subtle romanticisation that takes place in the advent of addiction. 

We equate the anxiety and wanting to this wistfully incomprehensible daze of wonderful illusion, akin to a magical dream state of tainted joy. 

Of course, addiction is nothing like that. It is horrible, insincere and unpleasant beyond a few magnitudes. 

Certainly, I am culprit to this kind of romanticisation and I think part of it comes down to how addiction touches us.

I think humans are somewhat obsessed with their vulnerabilities. There's something intriguing about 





it is due to how addiction touches you in ways that make you vulnerable and disconfigured. 

It almost feels like a pilgrimage of sorts, a dark ritual that exposes a side to our personality which seems essential, yet hidden. 

This is an openning to my mind. 






### Dealing

There's a lot of limitations. I cannot etc. 


Theres


I started associating it with my depression.

Now it is symbolic. It signifies my relapse.  





Growing up I was always dysfunctional to some extent. 





Understanding it is part of the appeal of addiction and in actual fact, actual addicts like myself are somewhat masochistic in our intent. 


It's like experience some kind of grand reset. 




Arguably, most men I know are addicted to porn.

It's a widely know, accepted fact, no different to sugar or coffee addiction. It's unsaid, because it's assumed. In fact, apparently it's weird not to watch porn. 

Quite simply, it's not right.

Though I'm not here to judge and provide a meta-examiniation of the socio-political aspects of porn addiction. Instead, I want to talk about my own personal experience and struggle with pornography.

I suppose it is a topic that is  close to me because it is a habit that has persisted since childhood.

I mean, I've tried a lot of different drugs and hell, I've even managed to get over a large portion of my mental illness - so I think that's saying something.

The good news is that I can largely control my addiction if I follow a bunch of strict guidelines, though I will generally relapse to varying degrees once every month or two months. 

## Why I relapse

Addiction is always a very personal experience for most people. 

Part of my addiction comes down to the intense curiosity I have for dysfunction.

In some ways, it is a culmination of the guilt and shame we feel on a daily basis, perpetuated by a kind of hopelessness that not only ravages, but completely destroys as well. 

Certainly, my porn addiction is not something I am proud of, though at times I also see it as a reflection of some of the darker elements of my personality. 


I suppose there are two things that truly trigger me, along with a heap of preventative measures. 

The first one 

## How I prevent relapse





## What it means to refrain from porn addiction




Arguably, I don't believe that makes it anymore okay doesn't make it anymore okay. 


Perhaps a good place to start is 

Porn addiction means a lot of different things. 

To me, porn addiction means not being able to orgasm during sex. 

Porn addiction means refraining myself from all forms of sex appeal. 

Largely, it is a process of mandatory desensitization. 



Porn addiction is something I'm sure a lot of people go through (in particular, men). 

The reasons for porn addiction are quite clear. It's a primal and dopamine response. 

Porn addiction is an incredibly serious hing. 

I have a very serious porn addiction problem. 

It's a problem that has caused a lot of grief in my life. 



I believe the current difficulty people face in trying to understand their depression comes down to the lack of intuitive explanations currently available on the internet.

Certainly, I personally spent years reading self-help articles and websites to no avail. Either the advice sucked or the information was too bloody convoluted to simply stick. 

In other words, these resources were ineffective because they were unintuitive.  

So let's try and undestand why.

##You deserve an intuitive high-five \*clap\*
