I hope you will read a stark and honest account of what it means to be a pornography addict.

Because I'm not okay.

Pornography addiction is horrible and debilitating condition that rips into your soul and exposes a very dark and twisted facet of your fragile personality.  

A condition that holds you down and morally corrupts every inch of your being, tearing into the social fabric of your mind via the incessanting taunting and suffocation. 

It is the kind of thing that leaves you anxious in a silent, though intimate wallowing, embroiled in several layers of guilt and shame, secondary to the subliminal wanting etcheing its message into your every thought. 

It is an on-going battle that never ends, no matter how confident or determined you think you are. 

I wanted to write this piece to provide some closure into the happenings of my mind as I chow down on the luscious grace shoving its fingers down my throat.

That my life is not okay, but that it's not all that bad. 

That I can be a highly function, though defective person.  

As always, addiction is an incredibly intimate and personal experience that lies on an unpredictable spectrum. 

Some addictions are minor.

They are meaningless preambles driven by chemical reactions and perverted curiosity. 

Foolish choices that drive the dopamine in our mind at a meander's stumble, as part of the routine congo line of lust and gluttony we all carry without care. 

These are the kinds of addictions that do not keep us up at night. 

They are vague inconveniences at best, tarnishing our image with a feint smudge of human indencency - a blemish that is soon forgotten, if not unnoticed.  

Then there are addictions driven by our beliefs. 

The belief we must feel loved by a certain individual. The belief self-worth is unattainable. The belief self-harm serves a higher purpose, despite our best intentions to logically resist and conquer. 

These are the kinds of addictions that place an empathetic gun to our heads and smother mother nature's ability to feel, breaking you down into helpless, incapable animal with no sense of life or direction. 

In my particular case, my relationship with pornography is the kind of addiction that resides in the depths of my beliefs.

Beliefs perpetuated by an insidious insecurity that eats away at me, swiftly evading my ability to think or comprehend.

Consume and squander. The motions feel no pain. 

While I don't quite understand my pornography addiction, I know enough to be able to explain the narrative that takes place in my mind, and as a result, largely control the outcome.

Though not consistently.

I will relapse and continue to relaspe, time and time again, if not due to the flawed simplicity of human nature.  

Arguably, I've become used to it. 

Not out of acceptance, but of honour. 

### Where We All Began 

![The Story Of How It All Began](/img/blog/02-01.png)

Like most male teenagers growing up, I would masturbate to pornography.

It was equivalent to drinking soft-drink or playing a round of Modern Warfare with the boys. 

You did it. I did it. Everyone else I knew did it. It was considered a normal part of the teenage experience. 

Then you grow up. 

To "grow up" is a very personal thing, however for me it was this sudden urge to no longer accept the self-percieved limitations of being a child. 

To take responsibility of my own life, rather than flow with the circumstances surrounding it. 

I believe this so-called "growing up" is a crucial period in a man's life where one ultimately tries to discover what it means to be male. 

A period of self-definition and self-discovery, of becoming your own role model and redefining who you are. 

Though maybe it was just me. 

I didn't really grow up with a central, functional father figure in my life, so perhaps it was an itch I'd always hope to reclaim. 

Regardless, the urge was strong. 

I began improving upon my health and fitness. I began developing an interest in knowledge, philosophy and self-help literature. I began pursuing my dreams and ambitions, as if nothing could stop me. 

One by one, I redefined my own morality and shed the self-percieved aspects of my personality holding me down. 

I became smarter, stronger and more resilient, and it is a process that continues till this day. 

Yet no matter how hard I've tried, I've never managed to fully crack my pornography addiction.

I mean, I've been able to refrain from it for months at a time and it's not an issue after I abstain for a week or so, however the addiction has always remained a reoccuring trend: a brutual curiosity I cannot quite kick.

In this sense, I've always viewed my pornography addiction as the last frontier in my quest to become better, and it is a symbolism that holds strong in my mind.   

Part of the reason for this addiction is due to the extreme confidence issues I developed growing up which persisted into my early 20s'.

I felt like a) I wasn't good enough to attract women and b) Even if I was good enough to attract women, I didn't personally know any to approach. 

In addition, the brief experiences I'd had with women had left a pretty horrible impression on what I thought relationships were, and so I viewed pornography as the only real alternative. 

That's just how it was. 

### I Am Addict

![](/img/blog/02-02.png)

As I'm sure you're probably aware, the act of orgasming is a naturally addictive behaviour. 

It is a dopamine bunny of "Fuck Yeah!" linked to man's most primal desire: To impregnate the world in a slurry of cum and unfortunate teenage mothers. 

Throw in the hyper-reality and extreme projection of pornography, and masturbating to pornography genuinely feels as if you're on top of the world, having sex with the world's most exclusive women. 

Men are largely visual creatures, especially when it comes to attraction. That's how they get you.  

In fact, it's amazing how my brain can convincingly trick itself into thinking I'm fucking someone another woman through a bunch of two-dimensional visual cues on a computer screen. 

As for how pornography contributes towards this destructive dynamic, the narrative of hyper-reality goes a little something like this, though I'm sure it's better explained elsewhere:

For thousands if not millions of years up until recently, before the advent of computers and wide-spread electronics, communication and mobility amongst humans was limited. 

Chances are you lived in the same area, with the same neighbours, with the same culmination of knowledge and culture, for your entirely bloody life. 

Neither did you have much exposure to other cultures or communities. It simply wasn't economical, at least for a majority of the population working on a farm or in the town centre. 

As a result, you lived in your own little world, mutual from the excess grandeurs of life. 

It was a beautiful equilibrium that agreed with the natural mechanisms of your brain. 

You see in this scenario, statistically speaking, everything in your world would have existed in a perfect bell-curve distribution relative to your surrounding population.

As per the bell-curve distribution, a majority of the people in your world would have been of average attractiveness. 

On the outliers of this bell-curve were those who were incredibly attractive, as well as those who were likely beaten to death with the ugly stick. 

Not that it affected your perception of the world, because you were never particularly overwhelmed by hoards of ugly or attractive people.

You would only see them very occassionally, much like in real life.

It was a stable distribution which kept your dopamine and expectations in check. It was "fair" if you could ever call it that. 

Of course, we now live in the 21st century where this stable distribution is no longer. 

We now have the likes of television, the internet, along with enough wires and cables to make even your most absurd sensory desires into a digital reality. 

In the process, significantly fucking with the stable bell-curve distribution our minds had largely become adjusted to over the past few million years. 

...leaving us with the cluster fuck that is pornography addiction and god-knows what else. (Video game addiction, anyone?)

With the internet well and alive, we can now view incredibly attractive women, completely naked and at their most intimate, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, whenever we desire. 

Not to mention, completely free of charge. 

I mean, fuck it. 

Of course I'm going to become a porn addict. You'd be insane not to. 

Furthermore, it's not just the increasing acessibility and quality of pornography which seems to be growing in leaps and bounds over time. 

The way porn is distributed over the internet is another integral part of what sucks you into the pornography matrix, spitting you out like a deformed slobber of inconsequential immaterial. 

Pornography websites are a lot like wandering through a perpetual casino of perversion and lust, where your every interaction is sucker-punched like an injection of pure dopamine to the skull.

At no point do you not feel compelled to click and explore, and give your life away.

With the thousands upon thousands of pornography categories vying for your attention, amongst the millions of videos currently available to the modern consumer, you become a slave. 

A slave to your own senses. 

Part of the thrill is that you never know what you'll find next and after a while you learn to derive more pleasure from discovering that next great video or pornstar, rather than from orgasming. 

Hundreds upon hundreds of videos, for hours on end, waiting for that perfect moment.

A perfect moment that doesn't exist, because you're an addict. 

You're a fucking addict and you don't care. Even you know it's bullshit on a certain level, but it's a beautiful ruse that keeps you going. 

A culture designed to cradle you to your deathbed. 

### The Dark Side Of Pornography Addiction

![](/img/blog/02-03.png)

Of course, the addiction doesn't stop there. 

It fundamentally warps you in ways that discard your humanity as an inconsequential lie. 

The guilt and degradation you feel crawls its way into the way you view pornography. 

You no longer view these women as fuck things. You instead watch pornography from the point of view of a performance.

You psyco-analyse them with an evil curiosity. Is she truly enjoying it? Is she on drugs? Does she have emotional issues? 

It is a perspective that changes the way you view women, not as actual people, but as unfortunate actors.

You learn to get off to the fact that it's not real and that these people are not truly enjoying the voluntary sexual molestation. 

It pleasures you to catch glimpse of their suffering, as you witness their false laughter momentarily falter into an uneasy smile of sadness and regret. 

You get off to the hurt they feel inside and you encourage it in your selection of pornography. 

Gang-bangs. Electro-shock therapy. Scars left from self-harm. Their discomfort becomes your pleasure.

I remember one time I was watching a small white girl get gang-banged by a bunch of black men. This woman was incredibly uncomfortable and in tears, as these men taunted her and poked fun at her helplessness. 

It immediately occurred to me that she was being raped (to the extent that she was doing it for money, but was both mentally and physically distressed). 

But as much as it disturbed me, I didn't care.

I was just pursuing the chemicals in my brain, because these chemicals are the only thing that matter to your addict mind. 

I believe part of it comes down to the desensitisation that takes place in the advent of addiction.

When the dopamine no longer functions, you have no choice but to attach yourself to more evocative emotions and feelings, such as adrenaline. 

So you start viewing videos that shock you. 

Your tastes turn from pleasure to violence, in this quest to feel as if you're winning. That you're making something of a shit situation. 

Another reason you do it is to bring her down to your level. 

When you become a porn addct, the recognisable, empathetic part of your mind disappears. 

And you want her to feel that. You want her to feel as worthless and dysfunctional as you do. 

While my pornography addiction certainly contributed towards this, my desires were also in part was due to my depression and circumstances growing up. 


The primary reason was that I'd always felt somewhat hopeless as a teenager with an over-bearing asian mother. I felt as if I had no real choice over my destiny, and so naturally gave up

That's just how it was growing up with an asian mother: you basically had no say. 

It was an aspect of my personality that grew to appreciating the feeling of hopelessness, guilt and shame.

There was a part me of me that craved this feeling of being controlled and being used.  

My porongraphy addiction allowed me to deal with this hopelessness, as if I were in-control.

In addition, I discovered that if I could keep my happiness and ambition to a minimum, then life wouldn't be so bad. It was shit, so why not just play along with how shit it was? 

In a sense, my pornography addiction was somewhat masochistic. I suppose self-harm can come in many different flavours, some more obvious than others. 

Despite how horrible pornography addiction actually is, part of me craves the dysfunction of being a victim. 

Certainly, I am culprit to this kind of romanticisation and I think part of it comes down to the way in which addiction touches us.

It doesn't just poke. It ravishes. I think humans are somewhat obsessed with their vulnerabilities and exposing them when other people are not around. 

There's something intriguing about going into that dark place and letting yourself go from responsibility, to explore everything civilisation wants you to repress. 

Though perhaps that's just my pornogrphy addiction speaking. 

I think though, that we inherently find it interesting to observe the disconfigured you because all though we brand them as wrong, they feel essential in the moment. 

Your mind tricks you into believing that it's really, truly you and it's a curiosity most people cannot resist. 

### Impact 

![](/img/blog/02-04.png)

I would argue that my pornography addiction is what has had the biggest impact on my life.

I would argue that the failure of my first two relationships were due to my pornography addiction.

Thinking that they were not good enough. That is was their fault I was sexually incapable. That it was them, not me. 

If it's one thing I can advise, please don't date a porn addict. 

We'll ruin your life in the worst possible way and make you feel horrible about yourself. It is something I have been culprit to and my only defense is that I'm a lot better now. 

When you're addicted to pornography you no longer view women as other human beings. 

You no longer view them as a collection of their talents and wonderful quirks. Instead you view them as eye-candy, to be fucked and discarded. 

I suppose what makes it difficult is that it's a perception that began from when I was a child, not only due to pornography, but also due to how horrible my mother was to me. 

So it's not only that I never had a proper appreciation for women, however it's an automatic response in my mind that I have to resist.

It's also part of the reason why most men struggle to talk to women. They can't get over wanting to fuck them to actually have a normal conversation, due to the constantly ticking porn brain trying to take over their thoughts. 

I personally struggle to talk to physically attractive women, especially women with big breasts. My porn brain instantly switches on and I have to somehow fight not to think about sex. 

I think porn is in part responsible for the whole pick-up scene: Insecure men wanting to fuck their porn fantasises at any cost. 

Of course, I'm much better now. I've regained a lot of my sanity over the past few years, especially being in a stable relationship. 

The absolute worst consequence of my habit however, is the lying and hiding from my partner that comes with being an addict. 

That feeling of betraying the trust of someone you love is something that you do not forget.

In a recent episode of relapse, I was watching porn on my laptop when my girlfriend entered the room, prompting me to minimise the tab and turn the volume off.

Anyway, she thought it would be really cute to take a video of us on my laptop, so she grabbed it off me and turned the volume on. 

It was horrible. Don't be that guy. It's devastating being that guy, let alone for the people closest to you. 

### Trigger and prevention Measures

![The Story Of How It All Began](/img/blog/02-05.png)

I believe what makes pornography addiction so difficult is that it doesn't kill you. It isn't an expensive habit, and you can still largely function and get away with it. 

The biggest thing that's helped overcome my pornography addiction, by far, is being in a stable relationship.

Here's why:

talk about how it helps you readjust. 


With this said, there are basically two things I need to do in order to keep my pornography addiction in check.

The first and most important measure is to refrain from orgasm. The second and less important part is to minimise my exposure to porn and anything too heavy on the sex appeal. 

It means I cannot watch movies with sex scenes, because it triggers me. It means being unable to watch Modern Family because of the breast size of the cast.

It means refraining from looking at attractive people in public. 

Perhaps counter-intuitively, sex doesn't trigger me so long as I don't orgasm. In fact, sex is important because it adjusts me to reality, rather than to the computer screen I've become so acquainted with.

With all these measures in place, I'm quite good. 

I don't think about it. It doesn't enter my mind at all. My life is at peace and I can concentrate on the things that matter, like my health and my coding. 

With this said, there are a still a few things that trigger me or at least will most certainly lead to relapse. 

The most predominant thing is when I orgasm during sex. It almost always by accident (though I'm quite good at remaining on edge after years of practice) or because we've decided to be naughty and give into our desires. 

Thankfully we're bothly highly aware of the consequences through repeated error, and so we remain adult enough to refrain from it. 

The other cause is when my relationship isn't functioning as I'd like it to, and I lose all hope. This is quite rare as I communicate quite well with my girlfriend, however we're all human and humans aren't perfect. 

Another trigger for me is when I get sick. The moment I get sick, I generally give up on most things. I stop eating healthily, I masturbate, I no longer care about anything. 

I generally relapse if my girlfriend is away for a long period of time. What makes our relationship work is that we keep each other accountable and the moment she's gone, I feel it difficult to maintain long-term plans.

The last reason is because I view it as a challenge. I know it's going to be difficult so I do it, not realising how pointless and how difficult it is. 

Put simply, addicts cannot trust themselves. I am not to be trusted with my addiction. 

I am only to be trusted when I have a process, a set of rules in place to keep me check. Then I'm mostly fine. However after a few weeks, it sometimes become an urge. 

Personally speaking, abstinence is the only thing that works for me.

Part of what keeps me in check is realising the benefits of abstaining. 

Not only do I feel a lot better and mentally stable, however my ability to concentrate and regulate my depression becomes easy. My energy levels are greater and so-on and so-forth. 

So there you have it. This is who I am. A broken, masturbating contraption of misery and regret. 

Of course, I'm not always like this. I'm only like this maybe 10% of the time, which is pretty good if you ask me. 

Good enough at least for this society. 













<!--



We equate the anxiety and wanting to this wistfully incomprehensible daze of wonderful illusion, akin to a magical dream state of tainted joy. 
, even though addiction is nothing like that. 

Addiction is this horrible, insincere and unpleasant experience beyond a few magnitudes. So how do we get so stupid?


In some ways, it is a culmination of the guilt and shame we feel on a daily basis, perpetuated by a kind of hopelessness that not only ravages, but completely destroys as well. 



Arguably, I don't believe that makes it anymore okay doesn't make it anymore okay. 


Perhaps a good place to start is 

Porn addiction means a lot of different things. 

Largely, it is a process of mandatory desensitization. 



You see, you make small aggreements in your head. When you make enough of them, you 


The only thing that works for me is complete abstinence from orgasm. 

I can still have sex, 

There's a lot of limitations. I cannot etc. 



It's like experience some kind of grand reset. 





To me, porn addiction means not being able to orgasm during sex. 

Porn addiction means refraining myself from all forms of sex appeal. 



Arguably, most men I know are addicted to porn.

It's a widely know, accepted fact, no different to sugar or coffee addiction. It's unsaid, because it's assumed. In fact, apparently it's weird not to watch porn. 

Quite simply, it's not right.

Though I'm not here to judge and provide a meta-examiniation of the socio-political aspects of porn addiction. Instead, I want to talk about my own personal experience and struggle with pornography.

I suppose it is a topic that is  close to me because it is a habit that has persisted since childhood.

I mean, I've tried a lot of different drugs and hell, I've even managed to get over a large portion of my mental illness - so I think that's saying something.

The good news is that I can largely control my addiction if I follow a bunch of strict guidelines, though I will generally relapse to varying degrees once every month or two months. 

It in general means I need to refrain myself from the porn mindset, which makes me want to do horribel things. 

Simply knowing the horrible things I've done as a result of pornography addiction is something that is a great source of guilt and shame for me. It makes me feel worthless to know all the harm I have caused in my own, and other people's lives. 


As time went along however these feelings would evolve into something greater. 

Soon the hopelessness would transpire into guilt and shame, and soon too, would I come to enjoy these emotions. 

Like a tangled vine, it would consume and walk all over me and it grew until I learnt to like it.

The guilt and shame reflected on how I felt in general about myself as this smart, though worthless creature. 

It suited my personality and how I felt, so I didn't have to question it. It simply was who I was.
