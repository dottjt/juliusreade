I believe the current difficulty people face in trying to understand their depression comes down to the lack of intuitive explanations currently available on the internet.

Certainly, I personally spent years reading self-help articles and websites to no avail. Either the advice sucked or the information was too bloody convoluted to simply stick. 

In other words, these resources were ineffective because they were unintuitive.  

So let's try and undestand why.

##You deserve an intuitive high-five \*clap\*

I cannot emphasise how important intuitive explanations are. They change everything and here’s why:

Good explanations are like compelling narratives. They are logical stories which provide us with obvious hints and cues to help us understand any situation.

Likewise, we can also think of the process of understanding as a timeline from « I have no bloody idea what's going on" to the « ah-ha! » moment of self-realisation.

Explanations are those vitla tools which help us get to that « ah-ha! » moment. 

Of course, not all explanations are made equal.

Terrible explanations, as I'm sure you're aware, get us absolutely nowhere. 

Like an awful film tied together on a shoe-string budget, the plot makes makes no sense and you still have no idea why the entire cast has been replaced by a series of traffic cones.

In fact, terrible explanations can even compel us to misunderstand what is going on, bringing on a whole new world of pain to our lives. 

Next to terrible explanations are average explanations, and they are really no better. 

Like average films, they’re entirely forgettable. They take us 50% of the way there, if we’re lucky, though are generally so bland we've forgotten what we've watched by the next day.

Not to mention, this also leaves us with the other 50% of the situation to try and figure out for ourselves, which if you're depressed and stuck in a rut of emotional issues, becomes naturally impossible.

No. For an explanation to be effective, we need to be taken 90% to 95% of the way there, or as close as possible to full understanding as can be achieved. 

Because let’s face it: When you’re depressed and are barely functioning, to expect someone to spend even 10% of their effort to try and help themselves is absurd. 

This is where intuitive explanations fit in.

Intuitive explanations are like timeless movies. They are beautiful and timeless and can provide us with a convincing narrative to help us better understand who we are.

Intuitive explanations are designed to take us 90% of the way there. 

They are designed to be so easy and obvious, that absolutely anyone can internalise them and come to a level of functional understanding. 

If they don't, then it's not your fault. The explanation simply wasn't intuitive enough, which means concepts need to be further broken down so it becomes truly obvious. 

Of course, there is a natural limit to these things and intuitive explanations can only take you so far.  

Even though intuitive explanations can take you 90%, perhaps even 99% of the way there, you still need to find the effort to do the rest. 

This is often easier said than done and like anything in life, there are no guarantees, only statistical probabilities.

Never-the-less, this article details an effective and simple process for you to reach that « ah-ha » moment in your mind, or at the very least get you 90% of the way there for when you're ready.

I suppose the insurmountable takeaway from all this is that if you’re struggling with anything in life, it’s most likely because you lack an intuitive understanding of the situation. 

Only with intuition can we easily grasp the things which at first seem impossible: Like our depression, for example.
