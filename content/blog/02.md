I believe the current difficulty people face in trying to understand their depression comes down to the lack of intuitive explanations currently available on the internet.

Certainly, I personally spent years reading self-help articles and websites to no avail. Either the advice sucked or the information was too bloody convoluted to simply stick. 

In other words, these resources were ineffective because they were unintuitive.  

So let's try and undestand why.
