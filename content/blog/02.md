I do not intend for this to be a pretty piece.

Instead, I hope you will read a stark and honest account of what it means to be a porn addict. 

Because it's not okay. Pornography addiction is horrible and debilitating condition that exposes an incredibly dark side to your personality that morally corrupts you down to the very foundations holding you together. 

It is the kind of thing that leaves you anxious in your own silent wallowing, embroiled in several layers of guilt and shame, incessanting taunting in the subliminal wanting etcheing its message into your every thought. 

It is an on-going battle that never ends, no matter how confident or determined you think you are. 

As always, Addiction is an incredibly intimate and personal experience that lies on a spectrum susceptible to all.

Some addictions are minor.

They are meaningless preambles driven by chemical reactions and poor curiosity. 

Foolish choices that drive the dopamine in our mind at a meander's stumble as part of the routine congo line of lust and gluttony we all carry without care. 

These are the kinds of addictions that do not keep us up at night. They are vague inconveniences at best, tarnishing our image with a feint smudge of human indencency - a blemish that is soon forgotten, if not ignored.  

Then there are addictions driven by our beliefs. 

The belief we must feel loved by a certain individual. The belief we have no self-worth. The belief that self-harm serves a higher purpose, despite our best intentions to logically resist and conquer. 

These are the kinds of addictions that hold us down and smother our ability to feel, breaking you down into helpless, incapable animal with no sense of hope or direction. 

In my particular case, my relationship with pornography is the kind of addiction that resides in the depths of my beliefs - perpetuated by an insidious insecurity that eats away at me, swiftly evading my ability to think or comprehend even my most basic needs. 

Consume and squander. The motions feel no pain. 

While I don't quite understand my pornography addiction, I know enough to be able to explain the narrative that takes place in my mind, and as a result, largely control the outcome.

Though not with a high degree of consistent accuracy. I will relapse and continue to relaspe, time and time again, if not due to the flawed simplicity of human nature.  

Arguably I've become used to it. Not out of acceptance, but of honour. 

### Where We All Began 

![The Story Of How It All Began](/img/blog/02-01.png)

Like most male teenagers growing up, I would masturbate to pornography.

It was equivalent to drinking soft-drink or playing Call of Duty. You did it. I did it. Everyone else I knew did it. It was considered a normal part of the teenage experience. 

Then you grow up. 

To "grow up" is a very personal thing, however for me it was this sudden urge to no longer accept the self-percieved limitations of being a child; to take responsibility of my own life, rather than flow with the circumstances surrounding it. 

I believe this so-called growing up is a crucial period in a man's life where one ultimately tries to discover what it means to be a man. 

A period of self-definition and self-discovery, of becoming your own role model and redefining who you are. 

Though maybe it was just me. I didn't really grow up with a central, functional father figure in my life, so perhaps it was an itch I'd always felt the need to fill. 

Regardless, the urge was strong. I began improving my health and fitness. I began developing an interest in knowledge, philosophy and self-help literature. I began pursuing my dreams and ambitions, as if nothing could stop me. 

One by one, I redefined my own morality and shed the self-percieved aspects of my personality holding me down. I became smarter, stronger and more resilient, and it is a process that continues till this day. 

Yet no matter how hard I've tried, I've never managed to fully crack my pornography addiction.

I mean, I've been able to refrain from it for months at a time and it's not an issue after I abstain for a week, but the addiction has always remained a reoccuring trend: a brutual curiosity I cannot quite kick.

In this sense, I've always viewed my pornography addiction as the last frontier in my quest to become better and it is a symbolism that holds strong in my mind.   

Part of the reason for this addiction is due to the extreme confidence issues I developed growing up which persisted into my early 20s'.

I felt like a) I wasn't good enough to attract women and b) Even if I was good enough to attract women, it's not like I knew any women anyway. 

I didn't know any women. My friends didn't know any women. In addition, the brief experiences I'd had with women were pretty horrible and so porn was the only real thing I had going for me. 

Then the habit becomes addiction. That's just how it is. 

### I Am An Addict

![](/img/blog/02-02.png)

As I'm sure you're probably aware, the act of orgasming is a naturally addictive behaviour. 

It is a dopamine bunny of "Fuck Yeah!" linked to man's most primal desire: To impregnate the world in a slurry of cum and unfortunate teenage mothers. 

Throw in the hyper-reality and extreme projection of pornography and orgasming to pornography genuinely feels as if you're on top of the world, sleeping with an array of the world's most exclusive women. 

Women you couldn't possibly dream of. 

Men are largely visual creatures, especially when it comes to attraction. In fact, it's amazing how my brain trick itself in that regard, utterly convincing myself of the grandeur of sex through a bunch of two-dimensional visual cues on a screen. 

As for the reason for the destructive dynamic of pornography, the hyper-reality narrative goes a little something like this, though I'm sure it's better explained elsewhere:

For thousands, if not millions of years up until recently with the advent of computers and wide-spread electronics, communication and mobility among humans was limited. 

Chances are you lived in the same area, with the same set of people, with the same culmination of knowledge and culture, for your bloody entire life. 

Neither did you have much exposure to other cultures or communities. It simply wasn't economical, at least for a majority of the population working on a farm or in a town in the middle of nowhere. 

As a result, you lived in your own little world with the same reoccuring characters in your life. 

Though it was fine, especially for your brain. 

You see in this scenario, statistically speaking, everything in your world would have existed in a perfect bell-curve distribution that was relative to your surrounding population.

As per the bell-curve distribution, a majority of the people you woud have know woudl have been of average attractiveness. On the outliers of the bell-curve, would be those who were incredibly attractive, and those who were awfully unattractive. 

Not that it affected your perception of your world, because they would have been the exception, not the rule. 

Accordingly, you were never overwhelmed, much like seeing people in real life, like on public transport for example.

I mean, you may occassionally witness an incredibly attractive person, but it was rare and on the whole, everything is rather... average looking, at least to the point that they don't capture your attention. 

It was a stable distribution, keeping your dopamine and expectations in check. It was "fair" or addiction-proof if you could ever call it that. 

Then the whole exponential growth thing happened and we invented a bunch of things to cope.

Now we have television, the internet, along with enough wires and cars to make even the world's most absurd possibilities into a digital reality. 

Though with a very hefty price. 

It significantly fucked with the stable bell-curve our minds had largely become adjusted to, leaving us with the cluster fuck that is pornography addiction and god-knows what else. (Video game addiction, anyone?)

With the internet well and alive, we can now view incredibly attractive women, completely naked and at their most intimate, all the time, 24/7, any time we want. 

Not to mention, completely free of charge. 

I mean, fuck it. Of course I'm going to become an addict. 

Furthermore, it's not just the increasing acessibility of pornography which seems to be growing in leaps and bounds over time (don't get me started on Chaturbate). 

The way porn is distributed over the internet is part of what sucks you into the pornography matrix and spits you out like a deformed slobber of inconsequential immaterial. 

Pornography websites are a lot like wandering through a perpetual casino of perversion and lust, where your every interaction is sucker-punched into a hit of pure dopamine to the skull.

You always feel compelled to click and explore, what with the thousands upon thousands of pornography categories vying for your attention, amongst the millions of videos currently available to the modern consumer. 

Part of the thrill is that you never know what you'll find next. As your addiction evolves, you soon  derive more pleasure from discovering that next great video or pornstar.

It's literally like a casino. Perhaps worse. 

In the end, you'll find yourself watch porn for hours on end, over dozens upon dozens of videos, waiting for that perfect moment to orgasm.

Which doesn't exist and can never happens. Because you're an addict. You're a fucking addict and you don't care. A ruse even you yourself don't in. 

It is a culture that cradles you to your deathbed. 


### The Truly Dark Side Of Porn 

![](/img/blog/02-03.png)

Of course, the addiction doesn't stop there. 

It changes you. It fundamentally changes who you, which changes the way you view and consume porn. 

You notice that the guilt and degradition you feel is beginning to reflect in your taste in pornography. You no longer the women to feel like you're having sex with them.

You instead begin to watch them to observe the performance.

You psyco-analyse the women in the video. Is she enjoying it? Is she not? It changes the way you view women, as unfortunate actors, rather than real people.

You learn to get off to the fact that it's not real and that these people are not truly enjoying the experience. 

It pleasures you to catch a glimpse of their suffering. When their false laughter momentarily breaks down into an uneasy smile of sadness and regret. 

You get off the hurt they feel on the inside.

At this point you start watching porn tosee them suffer. 

Gang-bangs. Electro-shock therapy. Scars left from self-harm. Their discomfort becomes your pleasure, because you don't give a fuck. 

You're just pursuing the chemicals in your brain because the chemical in your brain are right. 

Part of it comes down to the desensitisation that takes place in the advent of addiction.

The dopamine no longer functions, so you attach yourself to more evokative emotiosn and feelings, such as adrenaline. 

You shock yourself in this quest to feel; you pursue your addiction to feel like you're winning. 

And it's that feeling of winning that traps you and twists you in the worst possible way. 

Another reason is to bringing her down to your level. 

Because when you become a porn addct, the recognisable part of you disappears. It dies amongst a jungle of repetitive actions with no context. 

and you forget they are human in the process.

However, there was also a darker side to my addiction which arises from the depression that ensues. 

Part of me also enjoyed the hopelessness, the guilt and the shame of being addicted to porn.

I liked that feeling of being controlled and perverted, though there are a number of potential reasons why.  

While a large part of it had to do with my self-esteem issues with women, I think it largely was due to years of being an addict and being accustomed to my addiction. 

Another reason was that I'd always felt somewhat hopeless as a teenager, as if I had no real choice over my destiny. That's just how it was growing up with an asian mother: you basically had no say. 

In essence the pornography (in addition to video games) allow me to deal with this hopeless as a form of distraction. They were basically the only two things sustaining me until I was 20. 

Both were incredibly addictive behaviours that provided me with an escape from reality.  

I discovered that if I could keep my happiness and ambition to a minimum, then life wouldn't be so bad. It was shit, so why not just play along with how shit it was? 

As time went along however these feelings would evolve into something greater. 

Soon the hopelessness would transpire into guilt and shame, and soon too, would I come to enjoy these emotions. 

Like a tangled vine, it would consume and walk all over me and it grew until I learnt to like it.

In a sense, pornography addiction compells you to become somewhat masochistic. It almost helps make you feel as if you're in control. 

The guilt and shame reflected on how I felt in general about myself as this smart, though worthless creature. 

It suited my personality and how I felt, so I didn't have to question it. It simply was who I was. 

### The Impact On My Life

![](/img/blog/02-04.png)


There's a subtle romanticisation that takes place in the advent of addiction.

We equate the anxiety and wanting to this wistfully incomprehensible daze of wonderful illusion, akin to a magical dream state of tainted joy. 

Part of me craves the dysfunction, even though addiction is nothing like that. 

Addiction is this horrible, insincere and unpleasant experience beyond a few magnitudes. So how do we get so stupid?

Certainly, I am culprit to this kind of romanticisation and I think part of it comes down to the way in which addiction touches us.

It doesn't just poke. It ravishes. I think humans are somewhat obsessed with their vulnerabilities and exposing them when other people are not around. 

There's something intriguing about going into that dark place and letting yourself go from responsibility, to explore everything civilisation wants you to repress. 

It's this intense craving for dysfunction, though perhaps that's just my addiction speaking. 

In some ways, it is a culmination of the guilt and shame we feel on a daily basis, perpetuated by a kind of hopelessness that not only ravages, but completely destroys as well. 

It's interesting to observe the disconfigured you because all though we brand them as wrong, they feel essential in the moment. Your mind tricks you into believing that it's inherently you and it's a curiosity most people cannot resist. 

In terms of the people around me, the biggest impact pornography addiction has had on my life is the perspective I have developed of women. 

As a porn addict you no longer view women as other people. 

Women no longer become their talents or their collective personalities. Instead you view them as eye-candy, to be fucked and discarded. They become a rating on a scale and it's all your mind will process. 

It's hard because it's a perception that began as a young child, so not only is it engrained, it's automatic response in my mind that I have to resist. 

Of course, you might that that's just what men do. While this is true, the problem is that porn amplifies these traits to the point where you cannot ignore it. 

It's also part of the reason why most men struggle to talk to women. They can't get over wanting to fuck them to actually have a normal conversation, due to the constantly ticking porn brain trying to take over their thoughts. 

I personally struggle to talk to physically attractive women, especially women with big breasts. My porn brain instantly switches on and I have to somehow fight not to think about sex. 

I think porn is in part responsible for the whole pick-up scene: Insecure men wanting to fuck their porn fantasises at any cost. 

If it's one thing I can advise, please don't date a porn addict. We'll ruin your life and make you feel horrible about yourself. It is something I have been culprit to and my only defense is that I'm a lot better now. 

Porn also ruins sex, though that's a story for another time. 

Personally speaking however, the worst consequence of my habit is the lying and hiding from my partner that comes with being an addict. 

The worst feeling in the world is when you betrayed the trust of someone close to you.

In a recent episode of relapse, I was watching porn on my laptop when my girlfriend entered the room, prompting me to minimise the tab and turn the volume off.

Anyway, she thought it would be really cute to take a video of us on my laptop, so she grabbed it off me and turned the volume on. 

It was horrible. Don't be that guy. It's devastating being that guy, let alone for the people closest to you. 

### Trigger and prevention Measures

![The Story Of How It All Began](/img/blog/02-05.png)

Relapsing may not seem like a big thing, but it is. 

Certainly, it doesn't seem like a big thing at the thing. It's only once you've given in that you've realise you've sold your soul to the devil. 

There are basically two things I need to do in order to keep my pornography addiction in check and it is a system that works really well for me. 

The first and most important measure is to refrain from orgasm. The second and less important part is to minimise my exposure to porn and anything too heavy on the sex appeal. 

It means I cannot watch movies with sex scenes, because it triggers me. It means being unable to watch Modern Family because of the breast size of the cast.

It means refraining from looking at attractive people in public. 

Perhaps counter-intuitively, sex doesn't trigger me so long as I don't orgasm. In fact, sex is important because it adjusts me to reality, rather than to the computer screen I've become so acquainted with.

With all these measures in place, I'm quite good. 

I don't think about it. It doesn't enter my mind at all. My life is at peace and I can concentrate on the things that matter, like my health and my coding. 

With this said, there are a still a few things that trigger me or at least will most certainly lead to relapse. 

The most predominant thing is when I orgasm during sex. It almost always by accident (though I'm quite good at remaining on edge after years of practice) or because we've decided to be naughty and give into our desires. 

Thankfully we're bothly highly aware of the consequences through repeated error, and so we remain adult enough to refrain from it. 

The other cause is when my relationship isn't functioning as I'd like it to, and I lose all hope. This is quite rare as I communicate quite well with my girlfriend, however we're all human and humans aren't perfect. 

Another trigger for me is when I get sick. The moment I get sick, I generally give up on most things. I stop eating healthily, I masturbate, I no longer care about anything. 

I generally relapse if my girlfriend is away for a long period of time. What makes our relationship work is that we keep each other accountable and the moment she's gone, I feel it difficult to maintain long-term plans.

The last reason is because I view it as a challenge. I know it's going to be difficult so I do it, not realising how pointless and how difficult it is. 

Put simply, addicts cannot trust themselves. I am not to be trusted with my addiction. 

I am only to be trusted when I have a process, a set of rules in place to keep me check. Then I'm mostly fine. However after a few weeks, it sometimes become an urge. 

Personally speaking, abstinence is the only thing that works for me.

Part of what keeps me in check is realising the benefits of abstaining. 

Not only do I feel a lot better and mentally stable, however my ability to concentrate and regulate my depression becomes easy. My energy levels are greater and so-on and so-forth. 

So there you have it. This is who I am. A broken, masturbating contraption of misery and regret. 

Of course, I'm not always like this. I'm only like this maybe 10% of the time, which is pretty good if you ask me. 

Good enough at least for this society.

## What it means to refrain from porn addiction




Arguably, I don't believe that makes it anymore okay doesn't make it anymore okay. 


Perhaps a good place to start is 

Porn addiction means a lot of different things. 

Largely, it is a process of mandatory desensitization. 



You see, you make small aggreements in your head. When you make enough of them, you 


The only thing that works for me is complete abstinence from orgasm. 

I can still have sex, 

There's a lot of limitations. I cannot etc. 



It's like experience some kind of grand reset. 





To me, porn addiction means not being able to orgasm during sex. 

Porn addiction means refraining myself from all forms of sex appeal. 



Arguably, most men I know are addicted to porn.

It's a widely know, accepted fact, no different to sugar or coffee addiction. It's unsaid, because it's assumed. In fact, apparently it's weird not to watch porn. 

Quite simply, it's not right.

Though I'm not here to judge and provide a meta-examiniation of the socio-political aspects of porn addiction. Instead, I want to talk about my own personal experience and struggle with pornography.

I suppose it is a topic that is  close to me because it is a habit that has persisted since childhood.

I mean, I've tried a lot of different drugs and hell, I've even managed to get over a large portion of my mental illness - so I think that's saying something.

The good news is that I can largely control my addiction if I follow a bunch of strict guidelines, though I will generally relapse to varying degrees once every month or two months. 

It in general means I need to refrain myself from the porn mindset, which makes me want to do horribel things. 

Simply knowing the horrible things I've done as a result of pornography addiction is something that is a great source of guilt and shame for me. It makes me feel worthless to know all the harm I have caused in my own, and other people's lives.
