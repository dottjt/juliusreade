I do not intend for this to be a pretty piece.

Instead, I hope you will read a stark and honest account of what it means to be a porn addict. 

Because it's not okay. Pornography addiction is not okay under any circumstances. 

Addiction is a degrading state-of-mind, designed to capture and control with a fierce grip that desensitises and corrupts your ability to correspond to reality. 

It is the kind of thing that leaves you silent in the ensuing guilt and shame,  secondary to the subliminal wanting etching itself into your every thought. 

It is an on-going battle that never ends, no matter how confident you think you are. It is a state of helplessness you soon learn to accept and disregard. It is not your friend. 

Addiction is always an incredibly intimate and personal experience that lies on a spectrum that affects us all in different ways.

Some addictions are minor.

They are meaningless preambles driven by chemical reactions and poor curiosity. Foolish choices that drive the dopamine in our mind at a meander's heart beat, as part of the routine congo line of lust and gluttony we carry without care. 

These are the kinds of addictions that do not keep us up at night. They are vague inconveniences at best, tarnishing our image with a feint smudge of human indencency. 

Then there are addictions driven by our beliefs. 

The belief we must feel loved. The belief we have no self-worth. The belief that self-harm serves a higher purpose, despite our best intentions to logically resist and conquer. 

These are the kinds of addictions that hold you down and completely smother your senses, breaking you down into helpless, childish animal. 

For me, my attachment to pornography is the kind of addiction that resides in my beliefs - perpetuated by an insidious insecurity eating away at me, swiftly evading my ability to think or comprehend. 

While I don't quite understand my pornography addiction, I know enough to be able to explain the narrative that takes place in my mind, and as a result, largeyl control my addiction.

Though not always. I will relapse and continue to relaspe, for reasons I shall explain. 

Like a shooter with no target, sometimes it's just easier to pull the trigger on yourself. 

### Where We All Began 

![The Story Of How It All Began](/img/blog/02-01.png)

Like most male teenagers growing up, I would masturbate to pornography.

It was equivalent to drinking soft-drink. You did it. Everyone else did it. It was considered a normal part of growing up. 

Then you actually grew up. 

To "grow up" is a very personal thing, however for me it was this sudden urge to no longer accept the self-percieved limitations of being a child. It was a period that personally began following high school.

I believe this so-called growing up is a crucial period in a man's life where they ultimately try to discover what it means to be a man. 

A period of self-definition and self-discovery, of becoming your my own role model and redefining who you are. 

Though maybe it was just me? I didn't really grow up with a central, functional father figure in my life, so perhaps that's what spurred it. 

I started learning how to improve my health and fitness. I began developing an interest in knowledge, philosophy and self-help literature. I also began pursuing my dreams and ambitions, as if nothing could stop me. 

One by one, I shed the aspects of my personality holding me down. I became smarter, stronger and more resilient, and it is a process that continues till this day. 

Yet no matter how hard I've tried, I've never managed to fully crack my pornography addiction.

I mean, I've been able to refrain from it from months at a time and it's not an issue after I abstain for a week, but I have always returned to that dark place in my mind, with promises of hope and paradise. 

In this sense, I've always viewed my pornography addiction as the last frontier in my quest to become better. 

It is a symbolism that holds strong in my mind.   


### I Am Addict

![](/img/blog/02-02.png)


I had extreme confidence issues growing up and even into my 20s'. I felt like I didn't have what it takes to get a girl, and that    didn't really have the opportunity to easily pursue women, even if I had the capability. 

So as a guy, porn was the only real thing I had going for me. 

There was also a darker side to my addiction that related to my depression. In my sadness, I also enjoyed the hopelessness of being addicted to porn.

It felt somewhat comfortable for me, to be controlled and left feeling drained and worthless. 

That's how I'd always felt as a teenager, as if I had no real choice over my destiny. That I had to live with my horrible mother, along with my interal lack of ambition and happiness. 

Video games and pornography. They were basically the only two things sustaining me until I was 20. 

Both were incredibly addictive behaviours that provided me with an escape from reality.  

Soon, this hopelessness would transgress into guilt and shame, and it was an extra dimension to my addiction that I came to enjoy. Like a tangled vine, it would consume and walk all over me. I grew to like it.

You stop watching porn for the pleasure. You watch it instead to psyco-analyse the people in the video. Is she enjoying it? Is she not? You start viewing it as a performance and that's what gets you off. 

Understanding it is part of the appeal of addiction and in actual fact, actual addicts like myself are somewhat masochistic in our intent. 

On a broader level however, the guilt and shame reflected on how I felt in general about myself as this smart, though worthless creature. It suited my personality and how I felt, so I didn't have to question it. It simply was who I was. 

Actually, a side effect of my depression is that I can do this thing where I shut my mind off into this hopeless child-like state where I feel incredibly vulnerable, but also really, really good. 

Thankfully I've managed to steer away from these things and I no longer identify with my depression.

What helps is to view my past as a phase, no different to taking drugs and talking to the wrong crowd. It's just a phase you go through, no different to being an ultra-depressed human being. 

### The Addictive Anatomy Of Pornographic Programming

![](/img/blog/02-03.png)

The act of orgasming is a naturally addictive behaviour, hence addictive. 

It is a dopamine bunny of "Fuck Yeah!" linked to man's most primal desire: To impregnate the world in a slurry of cum and unfortunate teenage mothers. 

Throw in the hyper-reality of pornography and it genuinely feels like you're on top of the world, sleeping with an array of the world's most exclusive women. 

The destructive dynamic of this hyper-reality goes a little something along these lines, though I'm sure it's better explained elsewhere:

For thousands if not millions of years up until recently, communication and mobility was limited. 

Chances are you lived in the same area, with the same set of people, arguably for your entire life. You didn't have much exposure to other cultures or communities. It simply wasn't economical for a majority of the population. 

As a result, you lived in your own little world with the same little characters and relatively speaking, everything in your world existed in a perfect bell-curve distribution.

Everything is determined by this bell-curve distribution, including attractiveness.  

In this bell-curve a majority of the people you know are of average attractiveness, with few exceptions of those who are incredibly attractive and awfully unattractive. 

Not that it affected your perception of your world, because it was a stable distribution - as is often the case in real life. Some people are ugly. Others are attractive. A lot of people you don't even notice. 

It's almost "fair" if you could ever call it that. 

Unfortunately (though perhaps fortunately) communication and mobility exploded. 

We have television, the internet, along with enough wires and cars to make any possibility a reality. 

It may have also fucked a little with the stable bell-curve our minds are largely used to - especially for man's most primal desire.  

With the internet well and alive, we can now view incredibly attractive women, completely naked and at their most intimate, all the time, 24/7, any time we want. Not to mention, completely free of charge. 

For pornography addicts like myself, it is indescribable. Honestly mind-blowing. 

Furthermore, it's not just the increasingly wide-spread pornography which seems to be getting better and better over time (don't even get me started on chaturbate, talk about hyper-reality).

It also largely comes down to the way these porn websites are designed. 

Pornography websites are like wandering through a perpetual casino of lust, where your every interaction is like an sucker-punch of dopamine to the skull.

At no point do you not feel compelled to click and explore, upon the thousands upon thousands of pornography categories vying for your attention, amongst the millions of videos available to the modern consumer. 

Part of the thrill is that you never know what you're going to get. You'll end up watch porn for hours on end, over dozens upon dozens of videos, waiting for that perfect moment to orgasm to - because you're an addict. You're a fucking addict. 

Then your tastes begin to change. You begin watching porn to observe and examine the performance and the degredation on the women's faces. You get off to the fact that it's not real and that they're not truly enjoying the experience.

At this point your most satisfying moment is when you catch a glimpse of their suffering. Their uneasy smile breaks down into tears and you can seem them hurt on the inside. Yet it makes you cum. 

You begin intentionally watching pornography that makes them feel uncomfortable. Gang-bangs. Electro-shock therapy. You don't give a fuck. 

You just want to bring them down to your level, because you're so addicted you don't even remember that you're observing human beings anymore. 

It all becomes one big fuck-game and you're winning. You even get more pleasure out of finding that next great video or pornstar, because it's like a casino - you never know when you're going to win next. 

It's that feeling of winning you chase and it's a horrible scam that traps you and twists you in the worst possible way. 



### The Impact On My Life

![](/img/blog/02-04.png)

The biggest impact is my views on women. You no longer 

I basically cannot stop thinking about sex. 

The way pornography has impacted me is greatly reflected in the way I view women.

Pornography is terrible because you no longer view women as human beings. Instead they just become a rating. 

Women no longer become their talents or their collective personalities. They just become a glance on public transport as another interal rating of "would I like to fuck her?" 

On another level, I also believe that's what men in general do. It is in our genes to want to fuck everything. 

The problem is that porn amplifies these traits to the point where you simply cannot ignore it. 

Like, I struggle to talk to physically attractive women, especially women with big breasts. My porn brain instantly switches on and I have to somehow fight not to think about sex. 

This is in part why a lot of men struggle to talk to women. They can't get over wanting to fuck them to actually have a normal conversation, porn or not porn. 

I think porn is in part responsible for the whole pick-up scene: Insecure men wanting to fuck their porn fantasises at any cost. 

If it's one thing I can advise, please don't date a porn addict. We'll ruin your life and make you feel horrible about yourself. It is something I have been culprit to and has ruined many relationships. 

Certainly, I can say that porn ruined sex for me, though I'll leave that for another time. 

Perhaps the worst consequence of my habit is the lying and hiding from my partner.

I guarantee the worst feeling in the world is when you've betrayed the trust of someone close to you.

Recently in fact, I was watching porn on my laptop when my girlfriend entered the room and to hide the porn, I'd just minimise the screen and turn the volume down.

She thought it would be really cute to take a video of us on my laptop, so she grabbed it off me and turned the volume on. 

Not a pretty feeling, in particular for her. 

It has also greatly impacted a number of others things, such as my ability to concentrate and regulate my depression.

Not to mention, the addiction affecting my energy levels and all that. ,

Simply knowing the horrible things I've done as a result of pornography addiction is something that is a great source of guilt and shame for me. It makes me feel worthless to know all the harm I have caused in my own, and other people's lives. 

Yet there's a subtle romanticisation that takes place in the advent of addiction.

We equate the anxiety and wanting to this wistfully incomprehensible daze of wonderful illusion, akin to a magical dream state of tainted joy. 

Part of me craves the dysfunction. 

Of course, addiction is nothing like that. 

Addiction is this horrible, insincere and unpleasant experience beyond a few magnitudes. So how do we get so stupid?

Certainly, I am culprit to this kind of romanticisation and I think part of it comes down to the way in which addiction touches us.

It doesn't just poke. It ravishes. I think humans are somewhat obsessed with their vulnerabilities and exposing them when other people are not around. 

There's something intriguing about going into that dark place and letting yourself go from responsibility, to explore everything civilisation wants you to repress. 

In a sense, it's interesting to observe the disconfigured you because all though we brand them as wrong, they feel essential in the moment. Your mind tricks you into believing that it's inherently you and it's a curiosity most people cannot resist. 



### Trigger and prevention Measures

![The Story Of How It All Began](/img/blog/02-05.png)

Relapsing may not seem like a big thing, but it is. 

There are basically two things I need to do in order to keep my pornography addiction in check and it is a system that works really well for me. 

The first and most important measure is to refrain from orgasm. The second and less important part is to minimise my exposure to porn and anything too heavy on the sex appeal. 

Sex doesn't trigger me, so long as I don't orgasm. In fact, sex is important because it adjusts me to reality, rather than to the fantasies of the computer screen.

With all these measures in place, I'm quite good. I don't think about it. It doesn't enter my mind at all. My life is at peace and I can concentrate on the things that matter, like my health and my coding. 

There are however a few things that will generally trigger me and cause me to return to my addiction.

The most predominant cause is when I orgasm during sex. It is usually either by accident (certainly, it's a skill you build up over time) or because we've gotten naughty and we've both wanted it. 

Thankfully we're bothly highly aware of the consequences through repeated error, and so we're usually adult enough to refrain from it. 

The other cause is when my relationship isn't functioning as I'd like it to, and I lose all hope. This is quite rare as I communicate quite well with my girlfriend, however we're all human and humans aren't perfect. 

Another large trigger for me is when I get sick. The moment I get sick, I generally give up on most things. I stop eating healthily, I masturbate, I no longer care about anything. 

Lastly, I generally relapse if my girlfriend is away for a long period of time. What makes our relationship work is that we keep each other accountable and the moment she's gone, I feel it difficult to maintain long-term plans. 

It's usually 50/50 on this one. Either I will abstain or I won't.

Personally speaking, abstinence is the only thing that works for me.

It may also help to understand the small agreements we make. 

It means I cannot watch movies with sex scenes, because it triggers me. It means being unable to watch Modern Family because of the breast size of the cast.

It in general means I need to refrain myself from the porn mindset, which makes me want to do horribel things. 

Another reason is that I want the challenge. Of course, it's more because I'm foolish and forget how bad it's going to be. 

While these things seem small, it's how they get you. 

You see, you make small aggreements in your head. When you make enough of them, you 


The only thing that works for me is complete abstinence from orgasm. 

I can still have sex, 

There's a lot of limitations. I cannot etc. 



It's like experience some kind of grand reset. 




## Why I relapse


Part of my addiction comes down to the intense curiosity I have for dysfunction.

In some ways, it is a culmination of the guilt and shame we feel on a daily basis, perpetuated by a kind of hopelessness that not only ravages, but completely destroys as well. 

Certainly, my porn addiction is not something I am proud of, though at times I also see it as a reflection of some of the darker elements of my personality. 


I suppose there are two things that truly trigger me, along with a heap of preventative measures. 

The first one 





To me, porn addiction means not being able to orgasm during sex. 

Porn addiction means refraining myself from all forms of sex appeal. 




## What it means to refrain from porn addiction




Arguably, I don't believe that makes it anymore okay doesn't make it anymore okay. 


Perhaps a good place to start is 

Porn addiction means a lot of different things. 

Largely, it is a process of mandatory desensitization. 




<!--



Arguably, most men I know are addicted to porn.

It's a widely know, accepted fact, no different to sugar or coffee addiction. It's unsaid, because it's assumed. In fact, apparently it's weird not to watch porn. 

Quite simply, it's not right.

Though I'm not here to judge and provide a meta-examiniation of the socio-political aspects of porn addiction. Instead, I want to talk about my own personal experience and struggle with pornography.

I suppose it is a topic that is  close to me because it is a habit that has persisted since childhood.

I mean, I've tried a lot of different drugs and hell, I've even managed to get over a large portion of my mental illness - so I think that's saying something.

The good news is that I can largely control my addiction if I follow a bunch of strict guidelines, though I will generally relapse to varying degrees once every month or two months.
