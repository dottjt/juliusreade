I haven't been well lately. 

I've been suffering from anxiety to the point that I can't sleep. 

I know it's relate to this personal application I'm building, and I know it's because I haven't been honoring my mental health. 

There's a few issues at play.

Firstly, I've recently been coming to terms with the fact that I most likely have bipolar disorder. 

And I've been trying my best to understand what that actually means, as well as how best to approach it. 

Secondly, I've been following a number of habits that have made my mental state worse.

For example, as per my last post, I tend to create characters/glorifications of myself, in order to strengthen these dreams of delusion I create.

In fact, this original post was actually a glorification of bipolar disorder - but I've wisely decided to scrap that for something more tangible.

I suppose I could spend the next few thousand words explaining how I got to this point.

As well as what bipolar disorder is and how it interacts with my life, however that wouldn't do me much good, as much as it would be entertaining for you - the reader. 

So sorry about that. 

Instead, I'm going to focus on the path forward. 

I'm currently reading a book called The Four Agreements and I've probably read it around 7 - 8 times in my life now. 

It's a really good ...guide on how to reset oneself. 

I primarily have two of these guides - the second one of which is based on The Four Agreements. 

It literally explains in almost perfect detail, how you came to develop your mental illness, as well as what you can do to dissolve it. 

In just a few pages. 

It explains the whole dynamic of how we develop mental illness etc. in just a few pages, and that's why I think it's so incredible.

I suffer from bipolar disorder.

It is both the best and worst thing that can happen to a person. 

It is a double-edged sword of the highest quality, designed to shatter under the lightest of expectations.

It is what both dreams and nightmares are made of. 

You see, the reason why it's a nightmare is because it's a predictable cycle.

Which is to say that no matter how much you know about yourself.

No matter how much you change, or understand why you are the way you are. 

The cycle must continue to consume and squander. 

The reason why it's a dream is because it forces you to see things that you previously could not see. 

It forces you to be creative with your hope. 

Hope which turns into delusion, which transpires into helplessness. 

Petty as the death that surrounds you. 

Imagine dying, and then being born again. 

It allows you to live many different lives, and to experience the horror and beauty of every facet.

Every single unimaginable emotion, unturnt and unspoilt - as if the air were stale with freshness. 

Maybe you might like it. 

### Defining Purpose

![Defining Purpose](/img/blog/17-01.png)

I would argue that bipolar disorder is a by-product of modern civilization.

Much unlike a disease or a physical illness, a disorder is marked uncandidly as a side-effect to something unnatural.

In particular, as a side-effect to the creation of purpose. 

Which the end-user unforunately mistakes for happiness or some sense of wellbeing. 

Toiling the mind like a dead hamster on an electronic wheel. 

What makes bipolar disorder particularly destructive is how it contorts us into cultivating purpose.

You see, part of the problem is that purpose isn't real. 

It lacks honesty, and what cannot drive us toward truth can only fill us with false sentiment and void. 

Because truth is, humans can only be one of two things.

We can either have no purpose in our lives. 

Or we have so much purpose that life feels as if it has no purpose at all. 

Which is to say that the only way to strike a balance is to try and steadily balance our ambitions. 

Knowing full-well that our foundations are built on trickling sand. 

Of course, ambition doesn't care about it's origins. 

It only cares about what's ahead of it.

Much like fire.

And fire cannot be controlled.

Well actually, it can be to a certain extent - although it eventually always takes over, as I'll try to explain. 

You see, it's not about control. 

It's about memory and experience. 

### Defining Purpose

Bipolar disodr 





And I'm convinced most people have some sort of bipolar disorder, which is why we need to re-examine what it actually means to be bipolar. 




a simply a pattern to describe one kind of personality. 






And the reason why we've named it 'bipolar' is because it's a common pattern we see in people. 

Why is it so common? 

Well, that's something I would like to discuss today.

I've been trying to 'overcome' my bipolar disorder for years to no avail. 

I mean, I've gotten very close, but in the end I've realised that bipolar disorder isn't something that you 'overcome'.

Which is to say that bipolar disorder is a human condition, and for as long as I am human, I will always be bipolar.

The reason why I say this is because I've already got my mental health figured out. 

As in, I fully understand my mental health - what I must do to get myself out of a rut, etc. 

I mean this quite seriously - I have everything in my head figured out.

The only issue is that I'm bipolar, so all of that is meaningless.





I haven't been well lately. 

And I know it has to do with the app I've been building as of late. 

It's proving to be an absolute fucking monster. 

Of course, I can only mean that in the nicest of ways.
