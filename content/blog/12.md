Self-awareness is hard. 

It's sort of like this two-headed medusa that spits fire at you, much like a really bad ex. 

Okay, that's a poor comparison - but as you can tell, it's something that continues to frustrate me. 

Self-awareness is hard because it has a habit of catching you off guard at your weakest.

Because that's all it takes. One temporary moment of helplessness, and next thing you know you've downed  

It's fraustrating because even though it's something we have full control over, it's

We can be going so well with our mental health, only to have everything collapse in a moment of brass irrationality, when a trigger appears like a shiny pokemon in the wild. 

Certainly, this article isn't designed to make self-awareness 'easy'.

Self-awareness isn't easy, in the same sense that deadlifting 300lb will never be 'easy'.

Instead what this article is designed to do is provide you with a pathway forward, so that you can eventually deadlift 300lb, and not think too much about your severely compromised spine.

In this sense, it can help to think of self-awareness as a muscle. 

This thing you train that requires attention and maintenance, and that grows and improves over time. 

Which without practice and engagement, will die and wither - like your fruitless ambitions of becoming a YouTube star. 

Though wait, there's one little thing I forgot to mention. 

Self-awareness is no ordinary muscle. 

It's this spastic, stubborn, piece-of-shit of a muscle that at least initially, will very rarely do what you want it too, let alone function.  

So much so that your first few years of learning to become self-aware will be filled with months of forgetting that you were even trying to become self-aware in the first place, because you weren't aware enough to notice that you weren't aware. 

Then hoping your mental health improves in lieu of these circumstances, and assuming you even have the time to dedicate towards your mental health, you may resume working on your self-awareness for another week at a time, before forgetting for another few months into the abyss. 

This is the reality of self-awareness and why most people don't get far. 

Not only is your ability to influence this "muscle" limited, however it also offers no predictability what-so-ever. 

Not to mention, there's no official, nor predictable method for becoming self-aware. 

While meditation is the recommended means of enlightenment, it is also too subjective for most folk, can take years too long to master, and is largely incompatable with the millions of different interpretations of what it is and should be. 

Perspective on the other hand is cheap and like playing with fire, can backfire dramatically because we're also dealing with mindsets here - not merely thoughts. 

I've tried it all and it's a mess. 

Even this narrative is a complete jumble of incomprehensive nothing - and this is honestly the best I can do. 

So let's step away from the esoteric bullshit and try and make sense of what we're trying to achieve here. 

Because it's not easy, but I think I can help. 

### What Is Self-Awareness And Why Should I Care?

![What Is Self-Awareness?](/img/blog/12-01.png)

Self-awareness is so subjective to the poitn that I could spend hours throwing words at you and still not get anywhere. 

So I'm not going to do that. 

Instead, I think it will be benefitial to focus on the aim (or purpose) of self-awareness, so we can better understand what we're ultimately trying to achieve. 

In the most simple of words:

**Self-awareness is ultimately designed to keep you focused**

That's it. 

That's literally what self-awareness aims to do, in lieu of how we try to achieve it.

Now admittedly we skipped a few steps to come to this conclusion, and I promise we'll trace-back later in the article - however let's focus on this crucial detail.

Self-awareness aims to keep you focused. 

Now what does it mean to be focused?

When you break it down, focus can be split into two relevant categories: 

- Dedicating your effort and attention towards your goals. 
- Not being distracted from our goals i.e. mental illness. 

That's honestly all there is to it. 

I think where a lot of people fall flat is in believing that self-awareness is something much more complex or 'spiritual' than it really is. 

Cause it ain't so. 

The truth is that self-awareness has no meaning within itself.

Rather, self-awareness is a tool that allows us to create meaning, by allowing us to control our output. 

I repeat: 

Self-awareness allows us to get more shit done, which allows us to create more meaning in our lives. 

Put it this way: 

If self-awareness can allow us to work twice as hard and create twice as many awesome things, then obviously you're gonna think it's pretty fuckin' great. 

Now when you put these ideals in the context of meditation, self-awareness allows us to meditate longer, and better - hence why it's seen as this pretty great thing. 

The key point here is that it's only via hard work that we create meaning, and our menaing depends entirely on what you're trying to achieve. 

In the context of success, this means being productive and working harder on our goals and ambitions. 

Now if you've read my previous article on success (article below), you'll know that hard work does not refer to working your ass off. 

<div class="cross-post-template">
    <a class="cross-post-template-title" href="https://juliusreade.com/2017/03/31/success-is-nothing-more-than-a-verifiable-system/">Success Is Nothing More Than A Verifiable System</a>
</div>

It refers to the value and opportunity it creates in your life. 

So for example, meditating six hours a day is a hard work - because it can create a lot of value in your life etc. 

And self-awareness is what allows you to focus on producing hard work. 

### How We Prevent Focus 

![How We Prevent Focus](/img/blog/12-02.png)

As we've established, self-awareness is really about focus. 

To break it down for you, this means spending more time and attention on your goals, and less time and attention on things that aren't our goals. 

Sounds simple? 

Of course, but the problem is that none of us actually do it. 

The idea with self-awareness is that it's supposed to remind us of when we aren't spending time and attention on our goals, so we can have that "ah-ha" moment in our head and make a more productive decision. 

The reason why it's hard is because we've trained our minds to play tricks on us, that prevents us from remaining focused.

Remember earlier how I said that our self-awareness is like a "spastic, stubborn, piece-of-shit of a muscle that at least initially, will very rarely do what you want it too, let alone function."

Well, we created that.

Through mental illness and a number of other life-determining factors, we fucked up our self-awareness muscle. 

So naturally it's all retarded, and that's something we need to rectify.

Not that it's entirely your fault. 

Cause here's the thing.

Humans are stupid. 

We get bored. We stop giving a shit. We lie and decieve each other, because some of us are addicts and could care less. 

We come up with all sorts of excuses in our head about how our mental illness is important, and how distracting ourselves is necessary, if not completely vital for our existence.

I know, it sound stupid - but that's because we're not aware of it. 

When we let our urges get the better of us, we don't think about how awful or stupid that is for us.

We just do it because our brain switches off and we just do the thing.

Self-awareness is designed to switch your brain on again, and prevent yourself from repeating these patterns. 

Because people think ideologically, rather than rationally - and that's what self-awareness tries to stop you from doing.

To prevent you from thinking ideologically. 

Instead of thinking ideologically, in the "I must do this thing, because I fully believe it and feel it inside me" it gets you to think freely.

It gets you to stop in your head, and evaluate what you're doing. 

In the reverse, what makes self-awareness so powerful in terms of achieving our goals is that you realise you're not pursuing them because you're deluded.

You realise you're pursuing them because you've made a choice to do so. 

And you know it's a choice because you're fighting the stupidity that is inherent within your infallible human brain. 

And from that perspective, it's incredibly empowering.

There's your meat pie, bitch. 

### The Two Steps Towards Self-Awaresness 

![Your Stupid Brain](/img/blog/12-01.png)

Here's where it gets nasty. 

So brace yourself. 

Ultimately there are two somewhat seperate, though related processes towards becoming self-aware.

What makes them difficult is that it's very rare that you'll actually have these two processes aligned.

And without these processes aligned, you basically have no chance of being self-aware. 

Now mind you, what I'll be describing is getting yourself into a position of being self-aware.

On top of that, you also need to figure out how to use this self-awareness to achieve your goals - which is a whole different skill. 

The first step is calming yourself down, relaxing and actually be self-aware in the present moment. 

Remember - this is different from actually using that self-awareness to get stuff done.

Because in truth, self-awareness isn't actually the bulk of the hard work. 

It's sort of like a background worker that steers your brain from ruining things or having bad thoughts. 

In the overall scheme of things, self-awareness is quite passive because once you get good at it, you can actually use your hard work as a form of meditation and that's where you can become brutal with your productivity. 

Now here is where it gets tricky. 

The second step is knowing what to be self-aware of - and is perhaps the hardest part.

Because you can be calm, relaxed and focused - however if you don't know what you're supposed to be self-aware of - you're literally useless. 

In other words, the second step is gaining insight into what you need to be self-aware of.

It's sort of like when we discover a whole new way of doing something, or a new bit of knowledge that completely blows your mind. 

For example, like when I learnt 



Let's take meditation for example.

The reason meditation is hard is because we don't know how to meditate.

We have this idea in our head of what it should be, yet when we sit down and actually do it we can struggle.

We can't quite keep our focus. Despite trying to focus, our mind keeps wandering off. 

Yet the interesting thing is that all it takes is a bit of insight, and we can find ourselves doing it correctly.   

One example in my case was 

- 



In this state you are focused, 

The second step is to figure out exactly what it is you need to be self-aware of and why it's important. 

It's very rare that you'll ever get the two. 

So that's what this article is about - increasing your chances towards becoming less retarded. Good luck, schmuck. 



### Proving You're Actually Self-Aware

![Proving You're Actually Self-Aware](/img/blog/12-03.png)

So now that you know what self-awareness is (\*cough\* a rediculous regime to change the way you think and percieve reality) we can focus on making you self-aware.

Though before we begin, there's a pressing issue I should probably address. 

How can we prove that we're self-aware? 

Well, there's a few things.

If you're 100% focused on your goals, to the point where you're able to actively work on them everyday without distraction, then I would say that you're self-aware. 


Of course, here's the thing: 

You could equally say that it also means you're completely deluded - however I don't believe that's possible for a few key reasons.

For most of us, 


It's incredibly hard to get anything willfully done without control. 

Sure, you have people who get lucky on nothing but passion and ambition alone, but for the vast majority of us - control is what allows us to express ourselves to the best of our ability. 



In other words, if you're

The other aspect is control. If you're able to freely move between your goals without resistance, then 

For me that's writing and coding.

Truth be told, I don't really want to write. 

I mean, I love writing, however I'd much rather be coding and by gosh - once I start coding I don't stop. 

However since I see the value in writing, it's something that I'm able to dedicate my time towards 

This also proves that you're not deluded

I'm in control and when you think about it - that's really what focus is.



I choose what I want to do.

I think ultimately, what makes me self-aware is that 

It's being able to control what you want to do.

Because here's the thing:


I'd like to say that I think I'm self-aware. 


Put simply (and perhaps controversially) if you're not able to focus, it means you're not self-aware. 

Because self-awareness isn't just knowing that you need to be focused. 

Self-awareness is a practice. It's being able to control your thoughts 



### Making Self-Awareness Less Hard

![Your Stupid Brain](/img/blog/12-01.png)

One thing I wholly recommend you do is keep it simple.

Because your brain thrives on abusing complexity. 

To make it easier, What I recommend is to keep it simple. 



I briefly touched upon self-awareness earlier. 

It's an entity in your mind that you provide with focus and attention - because apparently you think those things are essential to living a productive and fulfilling life. 

Don't want to

Now, this may not seem optimistic, but that's hardly the point. 

Self-awareness is about bringing us closer to a more concise understanding of the world, so that we can spend less time battling our own thoughts and assumptions.
