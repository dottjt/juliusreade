The two very impossible steps towards self-awareness

The Two-Step Tango With Self-Awareness
Self-Awareness Is A Two-Step Tango
-->

Self-awareness is hard. 

It's like a two-headed medusa that knows all your password combinations and spits fire at you, sort of like an ex. 

Okay.

Clearly that's a poor comparison, but as you can tell it's something that continues to frustrate me. 

Self-awareness is hard because it takes a lot of patience and experience to make work, and even then it's not guaranteed to protect you from your own weaknesses. 

<!--
(though perhaps the point is not to try and fix our weaknesses, but to avoid them instead?)
-->

What makes it frustrating is that inspite of the fact that we have full control over our ability to be self-aware, it's not something we necessarily can control well. 

I know, because I've used it to successfully eliminate my urges at their worse, only to relapse a few hours later once I've let my guard down. 

All it takes is one offset of self-awareness, in a moment of sadness or frustration, for the wheels to fall dramatically off a wagon that looked so damn-good in that condition report.

It doesn't matter if you've been the best bumpkin for the past two years, or flying high in dominance without defeat. 

One moment.

And next thing you know you've downed a six pack of bourbon and the cat is dead. 

Certainly, this article isn't designed to make self-awareness 'easy'.

Self-awareness isn't easy, in the same sense that deadlifting 300lb will never be 'easy'.

Instead, what this article is designed to do is provide you with a pathway forward, so that you can eventually approach that 300lb mark (your mental illness, perhaps?)

Without having to think too much about your now severely compromised spine.

Because no one wants a severely compromised spine.

Unless if you're really into severly compromised spine.

Then totally go for it. 

Plz don't. 

### Self-Awareness Is A Muscle

![Self-Awareness Is A Muscle](/img/blog/13-01.png)

Ultimately, it can help to think of self-awareness as a muscle. 

This thing you train that requires maintenance and attention, and that grows and improves over time. 

Which without practice and engagement, will die and wither - much like your fruitless ambitions of becoming a YouTube star \*points at self\*. 

Though what we may not realise is that our muscles are actually quite complex. 

Muscles require nutrition, exercise, relaxation - all things we just seemingly do. 

It's just that for most us, it's not something we need to think or worry about. 

Instead, they just largely do their thing and we can carry on with our day without need for awareness over our muscles. 

Similarily, self-awareness requires context, understanding, empathy - all things we apparently don't do. 

So what's the difference? 

Well, chances are you're mentally ill. 

Which means you don't have normal, functioning muscles. 

Instead, you have spastic, stubborn, piece-of-shit muscles that (at least initially) will very rarely do what you want them too, let alone function.  

No different to someone learning to walk again - your mind is truly fucked to the point that you're going to have to relearn how to be normal again. 

In fact, it's so fucked to the point that your first few years of learning to become self-aware will be filled with months of forgetting that you were even bothering to become self-aware in the first place, because you weren't aware enough to notice that you weren't aware. 

Then hoping that your mental health improves in lieu of these circumstances, and assuming you even have the time to dedicate towards your mental health, you may resume working on your self-awareness for another week at a time, before forgetting for another few months into the abyss. 

This is the reality of self-awareness and why most people don't get far. 

Not only is your ability to influence this "muscle" limited, however it also offers no predictability what-so-ever. 

Not to mention, there's no official, nor predictable method for becoming self-aware. 

While meditation is a recommended means of enlightenment, it's too difficult and subject for most people to grasp, as it's a skill that takes years to become only slighly okay at. 

It honestly took me years before I even understood the purpose of it, and while my ability to focus has improved significantly - it's still not without flaws. 

Perspective on the other hand is cheap and like playing with fire, can dramatically backfire because we're also dealing with mindsets here - not merely thoughts. 

I've tried it all and it's a mess. 

So let's take a step back from the esoteric bullshit and try to make sense of what we're trying to achieve here. 

Because it's not easy, however that doesn't mean we must continue running around in circles. 

### Defining The Purpose Of Self-Awareness

![Defining The Purpose Of Self-Awareness?](/img/blog/12-02.png)

Self-awareness is hard because it's ambiguous. 

...or rather, because people don't know how it's supposed to help them. 

Certainly, it's one of those subjects where I could spend the next few hours throwing words at you and still not get anywhere. 

So I'm not going to do that. 

Instead, I think it will be benefitial to focus on the aim (or purpose) of self-awareness, so we can better understand what we're ultimately trying to achieve. 

Put simply:

**Self-awareness is a tool that is designed to keep you focused**

That's it. 

That's literally what self-awareness is, in lieu of how we try to achieve it.

Now admittedly we skipped a few steps here - however they're meaninglessness until we understand the ultimate aim of self-awareness.

Self-awareness aims to keep you focused. 

What does it mean to be focused?

When you break it down in the context of success, focus can be split into two relevant categories: 

- Focusing our effort and attention towards our goals. 
- Not focusing our effort towards being distracted from our goals i.e. mental illness. 

That's honestly it. 

I think where a lot of people stray is in believing that self-awareness is something much more complex or 'spiritual' than it really is. 

Which makes sense when you think about it, because when people have that moment of self-awareness where they realise how truly mentally ill and dysfunctional they've become, it can be an incredibly profound experience. 

However I have a more suitable interpretation that is more inline with what self-awareness aims to achieve: 

Here's my interpretation:

**Self-awareness is nothing more than a tool that allows us to create meaning, via control of our output.**

In other words: 

Self-awareness allows us to get more shit done, which allows us to create more meaning in our lives. 

If self-awareness can allow us to work twice as hard and create twice as many awesome things, then obviously you're gonna think it's pretty fuckin' great. 

The beautiful thing about this sentiment is that it also proves that self-awareness isn't something special. 

And instead, is merely a tool that allows you to achieve special things. 

This is important to understand, because self-awareness is not a perfect tool.

A lot of people who view self-awareness as this amazing, everything-solving solution can find themselves abusing it and not using it as intended. 

Assuming that it can protect them from all their problems, and completely ignoring the purpose of self-awareness in the process. 

So remember.

It's just a tool. 

Much like how you don't use a hammer to pass a car driving test. 

Self-awareness doesn't usually help us in situations where we have to deal with confrontational abuse etc. 

This idea of creating meaning in our life also extends to our mental illness. 

Many of us create meaning from our mental illness, which is significant for another reason. 

Self-awareness also proves that we have a choice. 

By becoming self-aware we can choose how we create meaning in life, rather than leave it to the unpredictability of our mental illness. 

Anyway, the key point here is that hard work (whether spent wallowing over our past, or building a career) allows us to create meaning, and our menaing depends entirely on what we're trying to achieve. 

In the context of success, this means being productive and working harder on our goals and ambitions. 

Now if you've read my previous article on success (article below), you'll know that hard work does not refer to working your ass off. 

<div class="cross-post-template">
    <a class="cross-post-template-title" href="https://juliusreade.com/2017/03/31/success-is-nothing-more-than-a-verifiable-system/">Success Is Nothing More Than A Verifiable System</a>
</div>

It refers to the value and opportunity you can create in your life. 

So for example, meditating six hours a day is a hard work - because it can create a lot of value via the insight it creates etc. 

Not because most people find it incredibly boring and mundane. 

And self-awareness is what allows you to focus on producing hard work. 

### The Two Steps Towards Self-Awaresness 

![The Two Steps Towards Self-Awaresness](/img/blog/12-03.png)

Ultimately there are two processes towards becoming self-aware.

One process is okayish, and other process is nearly impossible-to-control. 

And without these processes aligned, you basically have no chance of becoming self-aware when you need it most. 

Now please pay attention. 

What I'll ultimately be describing is about ideally getting yourself into a position of being self-aware.

This is different from how to actually train to become self-aware, which I will cover later. 

In addition, it is also different to the topic of how you can use self-awareness to achieve your goals. 

Modularity people. 

It makes life easier, not harder.  

We begin. 

The first step is calming/relaxing yourself down to a point where you can be actually be self-awareness. 

This is the moderately easy part that given enough time, that most people can learn. 

Not easy because it's something that just happens (it'll honestly take years) however easy because it's something we can (largely) learn to maintain control over. 

I like to compare it to a switch in our brain we can just turn off at will, and float away into a zone of focus.

Regardless, it's a skill that takes time - and is what I'll be providing instructions on in order to obtain. 

The good news is that it's a skill for life and a skill that gets easier with time, assuming you train it. 

No different to someone who's learning to walk again, once you streamline this mode of focus in your mind, it will no longer be something you have to think about.

You merely identify the trigger/empowering attribute and you don't ruin yourself. 

In the overall scheme of things, self-awareness is quite passive because once you get good at it, you can actually use your hard work as a form of meditation and that's where you can become brutal with your productivity. 

Now here is where it gets tricky. 

The second step is knowing what to be self-aware of - and is perhaps the hardest part.

Because ultimately, this is only something that can come with time and experience - the two things we don't have any real control over. 

I mean, you can read a book to help with the 'experience' part, but ultimately your brain is subconscious and is going to do it's own thing. 

You can be calm, relaxed and focused - however if you don't know what you're supposed to be self-aware of, it's like having a semi-automatic machine gun without a target.

It makes yourmore spastic. 

In other words, the second step is gaining insight into what you need to be self-aware of.

It's that 'ah-ha' moment of 'oh wow, I knew my guilt was pointless, but now I can rationalise it in my head!'

It's sort of like when we discover a whole new way of doing something, or a new bit of knowledge that completely blows your mind. 

Here's the deal - the remaining calm part is easy. 

However it becomes dramatically more difficult once you've been triggered. 

This is where the two processes come into play. 

Remaining calm, you must utilise your insight to remind yourself why it's all bullshit, and return back to pre-triggered state.

It's like defusing a bomb and when you successfully do it, you feel a million dollar.

Though here's what I've noticed:

Becoming triggered is a pathway that needs to be prevented well-before the event takes place. 

*Insert future article that explains this concept, cause this article ain't bout that*

<!-- artile on pathways and how everything is a pathway -->

### How To Become Self-Aware

![How To Become Self-Aware](/img/blog/12-04.png)

My biggest recommendation is to keep it as simple as possible.

Because your brain thrives on abusing complexity, especially when it comes to something as ambiguous as self-awareness.

Keep it simple. 

Think simple. Do simple. 

Because focus itself is a very simple state, which requires that you dissolve all your thoughts to one single thing 

Which I imagine would be the amazingly wonderful thing you're currently working on. 

Now the basic idea behind self-awareness is that it's designed to nudge us.

Nudge us when we're doing something good. 

Nudge us when we're doing something bad.

Nudge us when we're doing nothing at all. 

It's like your own personal assistant, only we're the one's in control.

The easiest way to learn self-awareness is to nudge ourselves. 

Which as the word nudge implies, doing things that slightly annoy us or keep us in check. 

The aim is to eventually be able to observe and notice our own feelings and emotions - however that can only come with experience. 

One thing that works super well for most people is placing a ball on the back of their chair at work or at home. 

This serves two purposes:

- It has a goal in mind, which is to promote correct sitting posture.

- It keeps you self-aware of this goal, as you can constantly feel the ball against your back.

Honestly, if you just do that permanently - you'll learn so much.

Of course, at some point you'll feel that it's too annoying/uncomfortable and want to remove the ball.

Now two things will happen. 

You will remove the ball and completely forget about it and your self-awareness journey ends here (what will likely happen).

You can stop. 

Observe yourself. 

Ask yourself why you want to remove the ball. Understand that it's because you're distracted from your goal (good posture).

Continue. 

Another very simple thing you can do is just take notice things that you don't usually notice.

Act differently.

For example, let's say you're walking to the station from work.

Stop.

Turn around and walk the other way for a minute. 

Then walk back to th station. 

Sounds stupid? No, it's not, because defying habits is an act of self-awareness and empowerment. 

The idea is to engage your brain so that it's aware of what it's doing. 

The main point is to observe. Act and observe.

The next step in this process is to realise that you don't even need to observe and that you can simply focus. 

Though we all discover our own truths.

Main takeaway?

Practice. It sucks. You probably won't do it. But that's the only solution. 

Personally speaking (aside from doing the ball on the chair thing) I also take cold showers. 

It's a safe way to observe your own fear and percieved pain, as well as how you deal with.

Cause trust me, that initial confrontation with freezing cold water never gets easier - but how you deal with it does. 


### Proving You're Actually Self-Aware

![Proving You're Actually Self-Aware](/img/blog/12-05.png)

So now that you know what self-awareness is (\*cough\* a rediculous regime to change the way you think and percieve reality) there's one pressing issue we haven't quite addressed. 

How can we prove that we're self-aware? 

Because there's an incredibly fineline between what is self-awareness and what is delusion.

The reason being that we all believe we're self-aware, simply because we believe our own conscious perspective is inevitably the right one. 

While a difficult question, I think there's one trait that ultimately defines self-awareness.

**Being in-control of everything**

I know it sounds like a massive requirement, however that's what self-awareness ultimately offers.

In particular:

- Being able to actively work on your goals everyday without distraction.

- Being able to switch between completely unrelated goals without hesitation. 

- Being able to detach from your goals without hesitation. 

All these factors have one thing in common. They all relate to control and living in the present moment.

Because when you're ambitious, though not self-aware, you're driven by an agenda. 

Which means this agenda affects the way you feel.

When you don't feel like you're pursing this agend you feel as if you're missing out. 



While it's easy to say that delusion has all these things in common with self-awareness, in practice the difference is quite significant.

Not being driven by an agenda, I don't burn out. 

I can walk away from my goals without having a complete breakdown, which allows me to relax and regain focus on other activities. 

The fact is, it's incredibly difficult to get anything willfully being in control. 

Sure, you have people who get lucky on nothing but passion and ambition alone, but for the vast majority of us - control is what allows us to express ourselves to the best of our ability. 

Self-awareness brings you choice, and it's the most beautiful choice anyone can have. 

<!-- 



We can be going so well with our mental health, only to have everything collapse in a moment of brass irrationality, when a trigger appears like a shiny pokemon in the wild. 



Now, this may not seem optimistic, but that's hardly the point. 

Self-awareness is about bringing us closer to a more concise understanding of the world, so that we can spend less time battling our own thoughts and assumptions. 




Now when you put these ideals in the context of meditation, self-awareness allows us to meditate longer, and better - hence why it's seen as this pretty great thing. 

If that's what you want to achieve.

For the rest of us, meditative enlightenment isn't likely what we want in life.

Instead, we want careers, money, an attractive and loving partner (or two) - and self-awareness can help you get there. 





/// distraction how we create distractions in life 


### How We Prevent Focus 

![How We Prevent Focus](/img/blog/12-02.png)

As we've established, self-awareness is largely about maintaining control over our focus. 

To break it down for you, this means spending more time and attention on our goals, and less time and attention on the things that aren't our goals. 

Sounds simple? 

Of course it is you doofus, but the problem is that none of us actually do it. 

The reasons are numerous, however creating systems, structures and routines is a good place to start. 

For more information, please read the article below:

<div class="cross-post-template">
    <a class="cross-post-template-title" href="https://juliusreade.com/2016/11/27/why-obtaining-a-full-time-job-should-be-your-number-one-priority/">Why Obtaining A Full-Time Job Should Be Your Number One Priority</a>
</div>

The idea behind self-awareness is that it's supposed to nudge us when we aren't spending time and attention on our goals.

So we can have that "ah-ha" moment in our heads, in order to make a more productive decision within the moment. 

In addition, it's also supposed to keep us engaged and focused on the things we are trying to achieve. 

Which is a huge aspect many of us forget. 

The reason why it's hard is because our mind has been trained to play tricks on us, that prevents us from remaining focused.

You know, like that time we subtly developed a mental illness or got massively addicted to some drug from the 90s'. 

Remember earlier how I said that our self-awareness is like a "spastic, stubborn, piece-of-shit of a muscle that at least initially, will very rarely do what you want it too, let alone function."

Well, that's the current state it's in.

"Like a shitty liver, you're barely getting by as you want another episode of JAG in a state of complete degradation."

Through mental illness and a number of other life-determining factors, our self-awareness muscle got fucked up. 

So naturally it's all retarded and stringy, and that's something we're personally going to have to rectify.

Not that it's entirely your fault. 

Cause here's the thing.

Humans are stupid. 

We get bored. We stop giving a shit. We lie and decieve each other, because some of us are addicts and could care less. 

We come up with all sorts of excuses in our head, about how watching another YouTube clip is vital, even though it's not. 

...and that's assuming you don't have mental illness. 

Then it gets even harder, as we believe we absolutely must be mentally ill, because it's the right thing to do and it's just a must. 

Sounds stupid?

Of course it is.

Desiring mental illness is absolutely stupid in the context of success - however that's because we're not aware of it. 

When we let our urges get the better of us, we don't think about how awful or stupid that is for us.

In fact, we don't think at all. 

**Not because we cannot think, but because we never trained ourselves to think in these situations.**

Self-awareness is designed to switch your brain on again in these moments, and prevent yourself from repeating these patterns.

Part of the probelm is that people think ideologically, rather than rationally - and that's what self-awareness tries to stop you from doing.

To prevent you from thinking ideologically. 

When you think ideologically you say in your head "I must do this thing, because I fully believe it and feel it inside me".

It is ideological because you have attached yourself to this version of reality, which although feels convincing down to your bones, is also not in your best interest. 

The way we prevent this is by thinking freely - without ideology or attachment to anything. 

Where you don't have urges or desires - where instead you have choice. 

The choice to act, rather than be driven by something we do not control.  

Self-awareness is powerful because it provides you with a choice. 

And you know it's a choice because you're fighting the stupidity in brain that is asking you to do otherwise. 

And from that perspective, it's incredibly empowering.

There's your meat pie, bitch. 



Let's take meditation for example.

The reason meditation is hard is because we don't know how to meditate.

We have this idea in our head of what it should be, yet when we sit down and actually do it we can struggle.

We can't quite keep our focus. Despite trying to focus, our mind keeps wandering off. 

Yet the interesting thing is that all it takes is a bit of insight, and we can find ourselves doing it correctly.   

One example in my case was 

- 



In this state you are focused, 

The second step is to figure out exactly what it is you need to be self-aware of and why it's important. 

It's very rare that you'll ever get the two. 

So that's what this article is about - increasing your chances towards becoming less retarded. Good luck, schmuck. 



It's sort of like a background worker that steers your brain from ruining things or having bad thoughts. 


Remember - this is different from actually using that self-awareness to get stuff done.

Because in truth, self-awareness isn't actually the bulk of the hard work. 




In other words, if you're

The other aspect is control. If you're able to freely move between your goals without resistance, then 

For me that's writing and coding.

Truth be told, I don't really want to write. 

I mean, I love writing, however I'd much rather be coding and by gosh - once I start coding I don't stop. 

However since I see the value in writing, it's something that I'm able to dedicate my time towards 

This also proves that you're not deluded

I'm in control and when you think about it - that's really what focus is.



I choose what I want to do.

I think ultimately, what makes me self-aware is that 

It's being able to control what you want to do.

Because here's the thing:


I'd like to say that I think I'm self-aware. 


Put simply (and perhaps controversially) if you're not able to focus, it means you're not self-aware. 

Because self-awareness isn't just knowing that you need to be focused. 

Self-awareness is a practice. It's being able to control your thoughts
