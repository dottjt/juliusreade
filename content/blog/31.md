The importance of identify beliefs. 
Identifying False Beliefs 

Addressing The Resistance Of Mental Health
-->

Hello there!

Today I want to write about some of the changes I've been going through lately.

In particular to do with mental health, so I can better grasp some of the concepts I've been trying to solidify lately.

From what I can tell, it's been around seven weeks since I first made that initial commitment to my mental health. 

And the whole thing has almost been effortless. 

Largely because I feel in control of myself and my actions.

I don't feel clouded by narrative, judgement or insecurity. 

And when I do find myself in a position of feeling those things, I know exactly what I have to do in my head to dissolve them. 

Now as you can imagine, this means that I've 'changed' quite a lot. 

However, what I would like to say is that the word 'change' itself is a very crude term, and one that I don't think accurately describes what's taken place.

You see, nothing in me has actually changed. 

I'm still me.

I'm still all my dark thoughts, my sarcastic humour and my complete fascination with pornography. 

I can still say stuff like "I'm going to fuck your mother with my fist". 

At no point have those aspects of my personality ever left me.

They're still there, no different to my victim personalities or my guilt archtypes. 

Instead, through self-aware I can have choice over how I interpret those thoughts/feelings. 

As well as ultimately, the thoughts/feelings I choose to produce.

I can choose not to take those thoughts/feelings personally.

Instead, I can choose to express happiness and be someone who is no longer motivated by fear and doubt. 

And I can choose to live my life without feeling awful about myself, by avoiding self-limiting narratives. 

Like, I can now look at something pornographic and not view it as a trigger to watch porn.

Because I no longer have that belief attached to porn, that it should be a trigger.

Instead, I just interpret it as a bunch of videos and images, and nothing more. 

I think a big worry for those addressing their mental illness, is this idea that they're going to violently change into something they're 'not'. 

And lose part of themselves in the process. 

Certainly, that isn't the case. 

It merely forms part of the resistance everyone feels in regards to addressing their mental health. 

And if you can recognise this, then you can also dissolve that resistance and realise that you're actually in control of what you believe and tell yourself. 

Which is what I want to write about today. 

### Identifying Beliefs

![Understanding Beliefs](/img/blog/24-01.png)

The core purpose of self-awareness is assist you in identifying beliefs.

Why self-awareness?

Well, because it's the way I know. 

Perhaps there are other ways to address your mental health that might work as well. 
 
Unfortunately, I have yet to discover anything other than self-awareness that's personally worked for me. 

In addition, it might help you understand that beliefs are synonymous with agreements. 

And thus can be used interchangable. 

Much like a belief, an agreement also indicates a level of control and will, one that is (perhaps) closer to how humans actually function.

And which will become integral to understanding the responsibility we hold over our beliefs.

In a sense, agreement is the verb form of belief, whereas belief is the noun. 

When you think about an agreement, it says a lot about how our beliefs dictate how we think and feel.

For example, if we make the agreement that we are going to get really mad if we see this one particular person. 

And then we happen to see that person.

Then obviously, we're going to feel really mad. 

Of course, there are a few things here that most of us don't notice. 

Firstly, we don't even recognise, let alone understand that we've created an agreement.

Instead, we say things like "That person really ticks me off" or "I can't believe how awful she is".

Through our language, we hide the fact that we've made an agreement about that person.

And so we believe the lie that it's that particular person who is responsible for how we feel.

Trapping ourselves into that paradigm. 

The problem for us is that in that crucial moment of visibly seeing that person.

Rather than recognise the agreement we've made, we instead get caught up in the story that 'this person makes me mad', and we have an emotional reaction. 

Which captures our attention and our ability to maintain control over what we think and feel. 

It's the same reason why people uncontrollably binge on snacks or feel 'triggered' by particular things. 

They get caught up in the emotional reaction, and it snowballs into a whole different world of it's own. 

### Why We Are In Control

![Why We Are In Control](/img/blog/24-02.png)

Now, I imagine the main point of contention is this idea that people are in control of the agreements they make. 

Well, I ask you to challenge that assumption, because it doesn't reflect the responsibility we have over our feelings and emotions.

Largely, because the outside world is open to personal interpretation, and has nothing to do with the world itself. 

Just as you can feel mad about seeing that one particular person, another individual may feel completely happy to see that exact same person.

Which means there is nothing 'concrete' or 'true' about the agreements we make. 

It is merely a personal interpretation we have chosen to adopt and give power to. 

Based on a simple thought or a feeling. 

So what's this mean for us?

Essentially, that we have the power to control how we feel, because we have the power to change the agreements and interpretations we have about the world.

And that's incredibly empowering, whether we choose to recognise it or not. 

In fact, to not accept it is a self-limiting belief. 

<!-- (although if you really want to get into the semantics, this statement is merely a lie to stop you from lying) -->

<!-- (again, it's about making these things obvious, so we can remove ourselves from the narrative of emotion) -->

The reason why it's important to identify our beliefs, is because it provides us with the opportunity to take ourselves out of the story.

In essence, it's impossible to both observe and be within a narrative at the same time. 

(at least technically speaking, although I warn it takes quite a bit of practice to get it right)

And part of what makes our beliefs so powerful is that we create them as these totalitarian structures in our mind.

<!-- link to love thy temple -->

That exist not to be questioned or dismantled, only to be further constructed and reinforced. 

Often, we do it as a protection mechanism, so we can feel justified in our agreements.

Which ends up forming part of the judgement narratives and archtypes many of us maintain. 

Yet when we take a step back, and realise that it's nothing more than personal interpretation. 

We can realise that these structures are actually quite frail. 

Furthermore, that they don't truly serve a purpose to our well-being. 

### Changing External Influences

![Changing External Influences](/img/blog/24-03.png)

I really like this model of understanding human behaviour, because it provides us with a lot of power to influence who we are. 

It's funny how many of us adopt self-limiting points of view.

With the understanding that because they are limiting, they therefore must have more direction in being able to guide us. 

The problem with this point of view, is that it actually takes responsibility away from our understanding of the world.

It limits our ability to take action, because we tell ourselves that some actiosn simply aren't worth taking or will be ineffective.

Based on what we believe.

Rather, I take the point of view that anything which enables responsibility should be embraced.

Because as long as we have responsibility, we have hope that there will be 'positive' outcomes.

Although I'm sure the reason why people adopt self-limiting beliefs in the first place is because they're afraid of change to begin with. 

In particular, 'negative' change which makes them feel worse about themselves. 

Rather, what they don't realise is that by having a self-limiting point of view, it actually becomes a viscious cycle. 

They feel worse about themselves because of their self-limiting points of view, which causes them to adopt further self-limiting interpretations. 

Which feeds into itself and becomes worse over time. 

A result of this dynamic, is that instead of trying take responsibility over ourselves, we instead try and forcefully change the world. 

(which is the great irony of it all)

Rather than recognise the agreement we have about a particular person or circumstance, we instead seek to change it. 

In other words, we try and change the world around us to fit our beliefs.

Rather than recognise our beliefs as merely personal interpretations, and therefore no worth suffering for.

And it's in this sense that we're all mentally ill to some degree. 

In that we don't realise our beliefs are the things pulling our strings, rather than the people and circumstances around us. 

Now, where this idea that we don't have control over our beliefs really begins to fall apart. 

Is when we feel as if there's some aspect of ourselves that we believe is making us feel uncomfortable, or unhappy. 

For example, we may feel as if our body isn't good enough or as if we're being unloved.

Often involving something which we cannot physically or mentally achieve.

But because we don't recognise this underlying belief, we continue to wreck havoc over ourselves. 


### Understanding Thoughts And Emotions

![Understanding Thoughts And Emotions](/img/blog/23-01.png)

Before I go into how we can identify our beliefs. 

We first need to understand how our thoughts and emotions interact with our beliefs. 

As they often act like proxies, secondary to our beliefs.


Now, our beliefs aren't everything. 

They merely form the structure of our mind. 

Second to our beliefs are our thoughts and our emotions, which act like proxies for what we belief.

And it often a really good place to search for underlying beliefs. 














### Visible Changes

![Visible Changes](/img/blog/24-04.png)

I think since changing my attitude towards life, it's helped normalise how I feel about the world. 



I think one interesting side effects of my general change in attitude.

Is that it's completely dissolved this idea of the work week. 

Like, I don't see the weekends as this sanctuary of freedom anymore, and weekdays as this kind of eternal drift of commitment.

It all blends together and feels the same, because my attitude remains the same everyday. 

Positive and energetic. 

A 'negative' consequence of this is that it feels as if time is moving a lot quicker than before. 

Which is interesting, because perhaps we have been taught to judge time based on tragic events within our life.

So that's what it's been like. 



I 

So what exactly has changed?

I think the main thing is that I can better identify myself. 

I can identify my range of destructive behaviours and personalities, as well as the beliefs behind them. 



<!--

So why don't we recognise it? 

Because we get so caught up in the emotion and within our own thoughts.

That we don't even give ourselves the opportunity to see the underlying belief. 

Instead, and particularly if we're not aware of it, we race on straight ahead to our thoughts and emotions.
