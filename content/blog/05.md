Today we're going to try something new.

Sparkling new. 

And for some people this is going to be difficult.

Partly due to the disconnect of reading an article over the internet, as one of the many billions of thoughtless "see-things" you will probably wade through today.

Apologies in advance for not being physically available in the room with you. 

Though not all hope is lost. 

What this article CAN probably do for you, is make you that tiny bit more aware of how seemingly useless you are.

You know, as a precursor towards change. 

Though I digress.

The reason why trying something new is difficult is not because it is hard, but because it is unfamiliar. 

And it is this concept of unfamiliarity that I want to drill into your head. 

The so-called "difficulty" we experience lies in challenging the neurological hardwiring our brains have succumb to since childhood.

Which requires a lot of attention, detail and effort - which we attribute to being hard.

It's important for us to understand this, because when we often describe something as difficult, we can make the assumption that it's because the task at hand is beyond our physical or mental reach. 

In essence, creating this self-percieved limitation in our minds that we are incapable of achievement, due to the misuse of words to influence our mindset.

From the point of view of familiarity however, nothing is impossible, hard, nor particularly inaccessible. 

Instead, we view the unknown as simply being unfamiliar - an incredibly powerful and enabling point of view.

A point of view that is based on our willingness to understand, rather than on any of the self-percieved limitations we may have of ourselves. 

You know, because there's nothing quite as motivating as being told that something is so fucking incredibly hard that you'll probably fail and die in the process.

"Approach the aggressive bear and smile." 

"Oh wait, the bear is now chewing on your face, but at least you now understand the value of trust." 

<!-- talk about the importance of process. -->

Now, there are a number of reasons why it's important for us to set these challenges for ourselves.

Primarily they allow us to better understand and exploit our capabilities as human being. 

And when we understand what we're truly capable of (hint: you are very capable) we can dissolve a lot of the insecurity and self-percieved limitations holding us back. 

In addition, when we challenge ourselves and leave our comfort zone, it exposes a whole new level of choice and responsibility that we may not previously have been aware of. 

In order to challenge ourselves, today we will be taking a look a specific behaviour that we will aspire to change. 

### Breaking Old Habits

![Breaking Old Habits](/img/blog/05-01.png)

Now there's a lot of shitty habits that people have, and today I'll approach something quite specific.

While this shitty behaviour may not necessarily apply to you, that's fine.  Because what we're truly interested in is the process - rather than the subject itself.  

After all, this sentiment ultimately sums up what this blog is about: 

Understanding the underlying process of how all processes work, so that we can adapt to any situation.

The key point being that you leave yourself vulnerable to future and existing bad habits by not understanding how all these underlying processes function.

<!-- The importance of being able to adapt -->

The challenge if you accept it is to refrain from using the word "sorry".

Because if it's one of my biggest pet peeves, it's people who apologise unnecessarily.

And yes, I am looking at myself.

I would literally say sorry in response to everything and I don't even know why. 

I just did. 

Furthemore, I can accurately say that it was entirely unhealthy, in addition to being completely unnecessary.

It was a unconscious habit (well, most habits are unconscious) that affected not only how others treated me, however how I viewed and treated myself as an individual.

Thankfully this is all behind me and in the process, I managed to develop a more powerful and effective approach towards expressing myself, that doesn't rely on apology alone. 

Of course, please do not confuse this as an invitation to be an asshole. 

Assholes are equally as ineffective as apologists, and I would happily argue that it's impossible to consciously be an asshole, without having severe mental health issues as well. 

Ultimately, this is an exercise of self-awareness, which will help us gain better control over our emotions and behaviours.

Because buzzwords. Fucking buzzwords. 

But hey. 

It works, so buckle up.  

### Addressing Our Bad Habits  

![Addressing Our Bad Habits](/img/blog/05-02.png)

For most people saying sorry comes down to habit. 

And habit is both our greatest friend and enemy. 

I suppose there's a sort of "unofficial" process this blog undertakes towards addressing our problematic habits, which I will aim to explain now. 

Firstly, we identify the issue or the problem.

i.e. You say sorry way, waaayyyy too much. 

Secondly, we try to understand why it may be an issue or problem. 

i.e. By saying sorry too much, you greatly increase your risk of developing a rare form of spinal cancer.

Thirdly, I'll usually try to provide some anecdotal context in order for us to become more familiar with the problem.

i.e. My name is Julius Reade and I have a rare form spinal cancer because I said sorry too much. I also have unrelated daddy issues. 

Fourthly, we try to develop a solution to the problem, usually outlining a detailed process which explains how to make it work. 

i.e. Say the word "carrot" each time you want to say the word "sorry". Seriously, or I'll murder your family. 

And lastly, we practice. 

We practice until we no longer have to think about it.

To a point where we no longer realise we're practicing it, thus developing an all-new habit within itself.

i.e. You have leveled up, but unfortunately the spinal cancer has progressed and you have now died.  

While a fairly basic process, is also a process most people are highly unfamiliar with (see what I did there!?)

Which means most people will struggle.

And struggle hard. 

This is part of the reason why I recommend consistently learning new things as part of our "recovery", because it will teach us to become more resilient and to more easily uncover these unfamiliar aspects of our personality, before it becomes too much of a burden (though clearly for most our behaviours, is already too late).

Drawing, mathematics, sewing, gardening, tap dancing - the more absurd the better.

<!-- The importance of learning new things -->

Ultimately what you'll discover in the end (life spoiler alert) is that all pursuits in life are more-or-less the same, and that all processes merely require your humble time and effort.

That nothing is inherently hard or special, that knowledge is knowledge and bees are bees. 

That your commitment is the only thing that matters to anyone. 

Of course, the other vital reason why learning new things is important is because nothing we ever know or understand is permanent.

And this applies particularly to our mental health. 

You see, us humans have a habit of falling in and out of delusion. 

"Oh look, that regret right there sure looks tasty". 

...and next thing you know, you're on a two-week cocaine binge to try and hide the guilt and shame drooling hopelessly from your misery. 

You become the fool and you pay the price. 

Again and again and again. 

Only through self-awareness can we maintain some sort of balance over our "unwieldy ambitions". 

Because I certainly don't trust myself to just "function", especially in a western society driven by the constant reminder that you're worthless if you don't SPEND.

Ultimately we are a product of insecurity, and part of this blog is about learning to fight back.

So fight we shall. 

<!-- How to beat the insecurity of society  -->

### What We Actually Mean When We Say Sorry

![What We Actually Mean When We Say Sorry](/img/blog/05-03.png)

To help us better understand our habits, we need to dig deeper into what we actually mean when we express ourselves. 

Because even though you're telling your ex-wife "I fucking hate you" what you actually mean is "I still fucking love you, but I'm really fucking confused and I have no fucking idea what I'm feeling, so please hug me, while I tell you how much I hate you". 

...and much like your post-marital confusion, what a lot of people don't realise is that saying sorry doesn't actually mean anything. 

Not only in terms of the very definition of the word, however also in terms of how we personally use it within the context of our own self-gratification. 

One of the primary reasons why people use the word sorry is because they believe it delivers meaningful promise or action.

Believe is the key word is, because it is an illusion we create for ourselves. 

We often use sorry in the context of "I apologise. I promise I won't do it again" or "I didn't intend to hurt your feelings". 

Ultimately, we say it when we feel unable to do anything or help anyone. 

Which sounds completely fair.

Except it's not.

Before I continue, I would like to say that there's nothing necessarily wrong with apologising. 

Apologising is fine when it is purposeful (which will be explained in the next chapter). 

What's not okay is saying sorry unnecessarily, especially when you mean only to apologise. 

It's not okay because we say it to hide how we actually feel and what we actually mean to say, which only helps to delude ourselves. 

When we dig deeper into what sorry actually means, it more accurately comes down to "There's absolutely nothing I can do to help". 

This is the message you drill into your head when you say sorry, again and again and again. 

But of course, you don't quite realise this because you don't actually say "There's absolutely nothing I can do to help".

You say sorry instead.

The reasons why it's harmful should be clear. 

Firstly, it says nothing about what we can actually do to alleviate the situation.

This is to say that it does nothing to empower us, but rather, serve to neglect our personally responsibility to act. 

It is what leads to despair and hopelessness, solidifying our inability to act.

Secondly, it is a form of lying.

We lie to ourselves through emotional gratification, because when we say sorry, we do it to make ourselves feel better, rather than because it is helpful.

And we associate these good feelings (or feeling of relief from guilt or shame) with actually doing or accomplishing something. 

It is a form of self-pity that appeases how we feel about ourselves - which on a more fundamental level, is no different to using self-criticism or judgement as a form of motivation.

Utterly disasterous. 

Disasterous because it doesn't work. 

Disasterous because it's entirely dishonest. 

Disasterous because we fail to question or address our own responsibility as an individual. 

So fuck that. You can do better. 

Stop lying to yourself and furthermore, stop lying to others. 

Instead we are going to be honest with our words, and honest with our intentions. 

Otherwise nothing will change.  

### Here's What You're Going To Do To Fix It

![Here's What You're Going To Say Instead](/img/blog/05-04.png)

I'm going to outline a number of strategies that may work, because if it's one thing I've discovered it's that there's no hard or fast way to change. 

Ultimately, we should be using our language to not only create reassurance within others and ourselves, however also to empower ourselves to take positive action and enact upon working solutions. 

But fuck that. 

Because it just ain't happening until you master the basics, and honestly, it's a process that's probably going to take several years. 

In the future I'll write guides on using positive language and mindsets to build confidence, however on the time being let's focus on some basic starting points for change. 

<!-- Building confidence and using positive language -->

Personally speaking, one of the best and most effective things you can do is simply become aware of yourself when you carry out these negative behaviours. 

Because from the point of view of familiarity, awareness really is the first and most crucial step towards change.

Which means consciously engaging these ideas in our brain, until it comes natural to us. 

Constantly remind yourself to think about it.

Then when it happens, acknowledge it, refrain from reacting and continue to keep it in the back of your mind. 

Certainly, don't wig out or get frustrated. 

It merely feeds more fuel to the fire, and self-criticism is merely another form of abuse within itself.

<!-- why self-criticism doesn't work -->

Another thing that's really going to help, is to say what we actually mean and feel word for word, rather than hide it in our language. 

As mentioned earlier when we say "sorry" we don't actually mean "I apologise". 

Often what we actually mean is "I apologise, I cannot help you" or "Please don't get angry at me, so allow me to appease you".

Of course, simply knowing how rediculous these intentions actually are, can be enough for us to stop the behaviour alone.  

By saying what we actually mean, we can pin-point what we're actually trying to say.

Of course, what you say entirely depends on the context of the situation and part of this exercise is about becoming more familiar with the pattern of language usage in our lives.

And as a starting point for this exercise, one thing that I've found that really works is substitution. 

For example instead of saying sorry to my partner, I would say "I love you" or instead of saying sorry to a colleague I would tell myself to nod instead. 

It's not quite a perfect solution, but it's a step in the right direction that works for a lot of people, in helping them become more aware of their actions.

On the other hand, I also believe saying sorry is a self-confidence issue, that largely relates to how we percieve authority in life.

However this is a topic for another time, and focusing on our ability to be self-aware is a much more important skill which will form a foundation for future learning. 

<!-- The importance of self-confidence -->

### It Will Be A Slow, Gruelling Process

![It Will Be A Slow, Gruelling Process](/img/blog/05-05.png)

Other than that, stay classy.

Because change is a slow, arduous and ultimately frustrating process - especially when nothing else in life seems to be working out. 

And let me tell you, no amount of lithium or spiritual humming in a cross-legged position is going to make this process any easier.

Because if it's one thing I've learnt, experience matters and unfortunately time does not correlate with experience gained. 

Chances are, you'll forget about the fact you say sorry for months at a time.  

Chances are, you'll react and get angry with yourself. 

Chances are, being self-aware of these behaviours will make you feel worse about them.

Hey.

I'm just the messenger. It's hard and it's scary and that's okay. 

It's a skill that will take years to master for most people, perhaps even longer.

What's important is a) It needs to be done and b) It can be done. 

So it doesn't really matter how difficult you percieve it to be, because you don't have a choice. 

And I don't consider withering way a choice.

Because withering away and being depressed doesn't provide opportunity in life. 

It merely destroys it. 

Just do the motions and eventually everything will fall into place. 

To make it easier for us, what we're personally going to understand is that these are challenges which everyone faces in life.

Growing up with a loving, supportive family doesn't make heroin any less addictive or the crushing heart-break of being cheated on any less difficult.  

Instead, it's how we deal with these challenges that will define who we are. 

Because believe it or not, everyone feels worthless at the best of times and while their mental health and ability to function may not necessary suffer, their excessive spending on luxury items in order to feel good about themselves or their complete lack of life ambition is equally no better.  

After all, we all live in the same crushing Western Society, with the same crushing expections, just like everyone else.

Except we're going to step up. 

We're going to become more functional and confident people.

And the only way to do this is by examining the habits, behaviours and unconscious choices we make on a daily basis. 

You delicious pervert. 

<!-- 



For example, I'm the kind of person who takes cold showers everyday. 

Now this doesn't change the fact that cold showers are entirely unbearable, however there's something about conscious "suffering" that opens  it's the mental perseverence that interests me

Though let's take a step back here for a second, and remove ourselves from the picture. 

Because at the end of the day, it's not about how we feel or think. 

We're tragic, dysfunctional human beings after all.

I mean, beautiful in a really fucked up, somewhat disfigured way, but for the most part that's not who we're aimming to be. 

Instead, let's focus on what the word sorry means to people who are confident and powerful. 

You know, the kind of people we are trying to emulate. 

The reality is that confident people don't say sorry for these exact reasons. 

Instead, they do a number of things which I'm going to highlight in the next section.

You know, so you can see an extra tile of my face. 

You pervert.



Which basically means you're probably going to die alone in a horrible car crash, if not due to my inability to prevent your fate. 

And please. Don't invite me to your funeral.
