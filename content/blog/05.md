Today we're going to try something new. 

And for some people, this is going to be difficult. 

Difficult because it challenges the hardwiring our brains have become so used to. 

Difficult because you may have never done it before. Though don't worry, that's just part of the excitement of change. 

It's important that we set these challenges for ourselves, not only to better understand our capabilities, but to grow and learn. 

The challenge, if you accept it, is to refrain from using the word "sorry". 

Because if it's one of my biggest pet hates, it's people who are unnecessarily apologetic.

I used to be that person, and thankfully I no longer am. 

To the point where I would say sorry in response to literally everything.

It's a bad behaviour, for a number of reasons I hope to outline through out this article. 

Though the term speaks for it's self. It's unnecessarily apologetic. It has no necessary purpose. 

Instead, what we will discover is that there's a mindset that's even more powerful and even more effective than saying sorry. 

Now this isn't an invitation to get away with being an asshole. That's just pursing the other end of the extreme, which is equally as tainted. 

Instead it's about understanding the power and reponsibility we have as people, to respond and act with integrity.

It's about becoming a more functional and confident person - examining the behaviours and unconscious choices we make on a daily basis. 

Confidence being the key word here. 

Because without confidence, you're basically other people's fuck-stick. 

Yet without respect, you have no use at all. 


Ultimately, the aim of this article is to help you understand that you don't have to say sorry 

### Why Do We Say Sorry?

For most people it is simply habitual. 

Most people who are unnecessarily apologetic don't even realise it, so let's try try and understand the origins of what sorry means. 

Firstly, I want to focus on people with confidence and power - because ultimately, these people are our role models.

These are the so-called "successful" people we are trying to emulate, so it's important we try and understand their mindset so we can apply them to ourselves.

In other words, what confident people think of the word sorry. 

People often use the word sorry in context of apology, guilt and shame.

They say sorry when they feel unable to do anything or help anyone. 

Which sounds fair, given that is often the case in our lives. 

What we're personally going to understand is that these are challenges which everyone faces, and it's how we deal with these challenges that will define who we are. 

Believe it or not, everyone gets addicted. Everyone feels worthless at the best of times. 

Do you not realise that all your peers ALSO live in the same crushing Western Society, with the same crushing expections, just like everyone else? 

So we're going to step up. 

One aspect of saying sorry that people aren't quite aware of, is the deeper connotation of what sorry actually means. 

Because when you say sorry you effectively mean: "I apologise, I can't help you".

"I can't help you".

When you examnie it closer, it reveals a lot about the intention behind saying sorry. 

Firstly, we say it in the context of addressing someone else.

At no point do we actually question or address our own responsibility as an individual. 

I think this reveals the irony of why we say sorry: 

In fact, when you think about it, the word sorry actually has no purpose or meaning. 

It really only has two purposes: To appease someone else by demonstrating your lack of authority and to appease ourselves emotionally, to feel as if we have somewhat addressed our own responsibility and emotions.  

Secondly, it a phrase that is implies. 




### Perceived authority

One way to help us deal with this challenge is to question our understanding of authority.

Humans are largely conditioned. 

We are conditioned with consequence. 

We create a number of consequences to a number of scenarios and we're

Of course, most instituitions don't only condition us with consequence. They also condition us with fear and 

Fear aims to prevent us from truly undesrtanding these consequences, because with fear these consequences seem much greater than we are.

With fear we create consequences that do not exist. 

Then there are incredibly corrupt institutions (often parents) that create completely unreasonable consequences, that frequently change and are so severe that we constantly feel afraid. 

It's not easy.
