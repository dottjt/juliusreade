The reason your life didn’t go as planned. The real reason your life didn’t go as planned. A meta-discussion on why your life didn’t go to plan. 

Why you keep failing. The difference between constructive and destructive failure. Failure is not a learning technique. Learning to plan ahead is the most important skill you will ever learn. What’s your plan? Creating an effective plan. You cannot succeed without a plan. Here’s why you keep failing: You do not plan ahead.

Almost every single one of the my failures in life can be attributed to not planning ahead. 

The truth is that I'm actually an idiot.

Given a viable plan, I will either ignore or complete disregard it, like an actual retard.

Learning to plan ahead is one of the most important skills you can learn to develop as a human being. 

The problem is that most people don't do it. 


Planning ahead is a very simple and effective way to future-proof not only your actions.

What most people don't realise is that planning is largely about managing and keeping your emotions in check.
