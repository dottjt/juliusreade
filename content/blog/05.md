Today we're going to try something new.

Sparkling new. 

And for some people this is going to be difficult.

Difficult because you're merely reading an article over the internet.

...as one of the many billions of thoughtless "see-things" you will probably wade through today.

Apologies in advance for not being physically available in the room with you, in order to deliver these words over a three-course meal and a glass of wine. 

Though not all hope is lost. 

What this article CAN probably do for you, is make you that tiny bit more aware of how seemingly useless you are.

You know, as a precursor towards change. 

Though I digress.

The reason trying something new is difficult is because it is unfamiliar. Not because it is hard.

And it is this concept of unfamiliarity that I want to drill into your head. 

The so-called "difficulty" we experience lies in challenging the neurological hardwiring our brains have succumb to since childhood.

It's important for us to understand this, because when we often describe something as difficult, we can assume it's because it's beyond our reach. 

In essence, we create this limitation in our minds that we are incapable of achievement, due to a simple self-created misunderstanding.

From the point of view of familiarity however, nothing is impossible, hard, nor particularly inaccessible. 

Instead, we view the unknown as simply being unfamiliar - an incredibly powerful and enabling point of view.

A point of view that is based on our willingness to understand, rather than on any percieved limitations we may have of ourselves. 

You know, because there's nothing quite as motivating as being told that something is so fucking incredibly hard that you'll probably fail and die in the process.

"Approach the aggressive bear and smile." 

"Oh wait, the bear is now chewing on your face, but at least you now understand the value of trust." 

<!-- talk about the importance of process. -->

Now, there are a number of reason why it's important for us to set these challenges for ourselves, such as becoming familiar with the unfamiliar.

Primarily they allow us to better understand and exploit our capabilities as human being. 

And when we understand what we're truly capable of (hint: you are very capable) we can dissolve a lot of the insecurity and self-percieved limitations holding us back. 

In addition, when we challenge ourselves and leave our comfort zone, it exposes a whole new level of choice and responsibility that may not have previously been aware to us. 

In order to challenge ourselves, today we will be taking a look a specific behaviour that we will aspire to change. 

### Breaking Old Habits

![Breaking Old Habits](/img/blog/05-01.png)

Now there's a lot of shitty habits that people have, and today I'll approach something quite specific.

It is a shitty behaviour that may not necessarily apply to you, and that's fine. 

Because what we're truly interested in is the process - rather than the subject itself.  

After all, this is really what this blog is about: Understanding the underlying process of how all processes work, so that we can adapt to any situation.

The key point being that you leave yourself vulnerable to future and existing bad habits without this ability to adapt. 

<!-- The importance of being able to adapt -->

The challenge if you accept it is to refrain from using the word "sorry".

Because if it's one of my biggest pet peeves, it's people who apologise unnecessarily.

Precisely as something who used to apologise unnecessarily.

I would literally say sorry in response to everything and I don't even know why. I just did. 

And I can accurately say that it was not only unnecessary, but unhealthy as well.

It was a unconscious habit that affected not only how others treated me, however how I viewed and treated myself as an individual.

Thankfully this is all behind me and in the process, I managed to develop a more powerful and effective approach towards expressing myself, that doesn't rely on apology alone. 

Of course, please do not confuse this as an invitation to be an asshole. 

Assholes are equally as ineffective as apologists, and I would happily argue that it's impossible to consciously be an asshole, without having severe mental health issues as well. 

Ultimately, this is an exercise of self-awareness, which will help us gain better control over our emotions and behaviours.

Because buzzwords. Fucking buzzwords. 

But hey. 

It works, so buckle up.  

### Addressing Our Bad Habits  

![Addressing Our Bad Habits](/img/blog/05-02.png)

For most people saying sorry comes down to habit. 

And habit is both our greatest friend and enemy. 

I suppose there's a sort of "unofficial" process this blog undertakes towards addressing our problematic habits, which I will aim to explain now. 

Firstly, we identify the issue or the problem.

i.e. You say sorry way, waaayyyy too much. 

Secondly, we try to understand why it may be an issue or problem. 

i.e. By saying sorry too much, you greatly increase your risk of developing a rare form of spinal cancer.

Thirdly, I'll usually try to provide some anecdotal context in order for us to become more familiar with the problem.

i.e. My name is Julius Reade and I have a rare form spinal cancer because I said sorry too much. I also have unrelated daddy issues. 

Fourthly, we try to develop a solution to the problem, including outlining a detailed process which explains how to make it work. 

i.e. Say the word "carrot" each time you want to say the word "sorry". Seriously, or I'll murder your family. 

And lastly, we practice. 

We practice until we no longer have to think about it.

To a point where we no longer realise we're practicing it, thus developing an all-new habit within itself.

i.e. You have leveled up, but unfortunately the spinal cancer has progressed and you have now died.  

While a fairly basic process, is also a process most people are highly unfamiliar with (see what I did there!?)

Which means most people will struggle.

And struggle hard. 

This is part of the reason why I recommend consistently learning new things as part of our "recovery", because it teaches us to become more resilient and to more easily uncover these unfamiliar aspects of our personality, before it becomes too much of a burden.

Drawing, mathematics, sewing, gardening, tap dancing - the more absurd the better.

<!-- The importance of learning new things -->

Ultimately what you'll discover in the end (life spoiler alert) is that all pursuits in life are more-or-less the same, and that all processes merely require your humble time and effort.

That nothing is inherently hard or special, that knowledge is knowledge and bees are bees. 

That your commitment is the only thing that matters to anyone. 

Of course, the other vital reason why learning new things is important is because nothing we ever know or understand is permanent.

And this applies particularly to our mental health. 

You see, us humans have a habit of falling in and out of delusion. 

"Oh look, that regret right there sure looks tasty". 

...and next thing you know, we're on a two-week cocaine binge to get over how hopeless we feel. 

You become the fool and you pay the price. 

Again and again and again. 

Only through self-awareness can we maintain some sort of balance over our "unwieldy ambitions". 

Because I certainly don't trust myself to just "function", especially in western society driven by the constant reminder that you're worthless if you don't SPEND.

Ultimately we are a product of insecurity, and part of this blog is about learning to fight back.

So fight we shall.

### What We Actually Mean When We Say Sorry

![What We Actually Mean When We Say Sorry](/img/blog/05-03.png)

To help us better understand our habits, we need to dig deeper into what we actually mean when we express ourselves. 

Because even though you're telling your ex-wife "I fucking hate you" what you actually mean is "I still fucking love you, but I'm really fucking confused and I have no fucking idea what I'm feeling, so please hug me, while I tell you how much I hate you". 

...and much like your post-marital confusion, what a lot of people don't realise is that saying sorry doesn't actually mean anything. 

Not only in terms of the very definition of the word, however also in terms of how we personally use it, within the context of our own self-gratification. 

To get to straight to the point, the primary reason why people use the word sorry is because they believe it is delivering some kind of meaningful promise or action.

Believe is the key word is. It is all an illusion we create for ourselves. 

We often use sorry in the context of "I apologise. I promise I won't do it again." or "I didn't intend to hurt your feelings" 

We say it when we feel unable to do anything or help anyone, which sounds completely fair.

Except it's not, as I will try to explain.

Before I continue, I would like to say that there's nothing necessarily wrong with apology. 

Apologising is fine when done right (which will be explained in the next chapter). 

What's not okay is saying sorry when you want to apologise.

Because when we dig deeper into what sorry actually means for those who say it unnecessarily, it more accurately comes down to "There's absolutely nothing I can do to help you". 

"There's absolutely nothing I can do to help you".

When you incessantly say sorry again and again and again, this is the message you drill into your head, along with all the attached connotations. 

The reasons are simple. 

Firstly, it says nothing about what you can do. 

Instead it removes our responsibility from the situation, and solidifies our inability to act. 

It is a prime behaviour for breeding hopelessness.

Secondly, it is lying to yourself through emotional gratification. 

When we say sorry, we wrongly associate saying sorry with actually doing something.

Not because it actually does, but because the act of saying sorry reliefs the guilt and shame we feel for doing wrong. 

It is self-pity that appeases how we feel about ourselves - which is no different to using self-criticism or judgement to motivate ourselves.

Utterly disasterous. 

Disasterous because it doesn't work. Disasterous because it's entirely dishonest. 

Disasterous because we fail to question or address our own responsibility as an individual. 

So fuck that. You can do better. 

Stop lying to yourself and furthermore, stop lying to others. 

Instead we are going to be honest with our words, and honest with our intentions. 

It's the only way. 

### Here's What You're Going To Do To Fix It

![Here's What You're Going To Say Instead](/img/blog/05-04.png)

I'm going to outline a number of strategies, because if it's one thing I've discovered it's that there's no hard or fast way to change. 

Often the best thing you can do is simply become aware of yourself when you do it. 

Because from the point of view of familiarity, awareness is really the first and most crucial step towards change.

At the end of the day, this is about changing neural responses and behaviours in our brain. 

Which means consciously engaging these ideas in our brain, until it comes natural to us. 

Think about it. 

When it happens, simply acknowledge it and keep it in your mind. 

Certainly, don't react or get frustrated. Self-criticism doesn't work because it creates other negative side-effects that negate self-awareness.

Of course, this is always the first rule. 

One thing that is really going to help from a less passive point of view, will be to spell out what we actually mean, rather than hide it in our language. 

As mentioned earlier, when we say "sorry" we don't actually mean sorry. 

Often what we actually mean is "I apologise, I cannot help you" or "Please don't get angry at me, so let me appease you".

Instead by saying what we mean, we can pin-point what we're actually trying to say - rather than what we're trying to hide. 

One way we can break this cycle of apology is to actually say what we mean. 

By saying what we mean, we can become consciously aware of what we're actually saying. 

Instead of saying "sorry" we can say "I don't quite understand what you're saying" or "I apologise for upsetting you".

What you say entirely depends on the context and it's a pattern you're going to slowly discover the more you think about it.

As a starting point, one thing that I found really works is substitution. 

Instead of saying sorry to my partner, I would say "I love you" or instead of sorry to a colleague I would tell myself to nod instead. 

It's not quite a perfect solution, but it's a step in the right direction that works for a lot of people. 

On the other hand, I also believe saying sorry is a self-confidence issue and that perception plays a large part in dictating our actions. 

The problem with .


Confidence being the key word here. 

Because without confidence, you're basically other people's fuck-stick. 

Yet without respect, you have no use at all. 




One way to help us deal with this challenge is to question our understanding of authority.

Humans are largely conditioned. 

We are conditioned with consequence. 

We create a number of consequences to a number of scenarios and we're

Of course, most instituitions don't only condition us with consequence. They also condition us with fear and 

Fear aims to prevent us from truly undesrtanding these consequences, because with fear these consequences seem much greater than we are.

With fear we create consequences that do not exist. 

Then there are incredibly corrupt institutions (often parents) that create completely unreasonable consequences, that frequently change and are so severe that we constantly feel afraid. 

It's not easy. 

Confident people dont's say sorry.




### It Will Be A Slow, Gruelling Process

![It Will Be A Slow, Gruelling Process](/img/blog/05-05.png)

Other than that, stay classy.

Because change is a slow, arduous and ultimately frustrating process - especially when nothing else in life can seem to be working. 

And let me tell you, no amount of lithium or tibetan humming in a cross-legged pose is going to make this process any easier.

Because if it's one thing I've learnt, experience matters and unfortunately time does not correlate with experience gained. 

Chances are, you'll forget about the fact you say sorry for months at a time.  

Chances are, you're probably going to be able to stop reacting to these behaviours, and being self-aware will make you feel worse and fuck shit up. 

I'm just the messenger. It's hard and scary and that's okay. 

It's a skill that for most people will take years to master, perhaps even longer.

What's important is that it needs to be done and that it can be done. 

So it doesn't really matter how difficult is, because you don't have a choice. 

And I don't consider withering way a choice.

Because withering and depression doesn't provide opportunity. It destroys it. 

Don't focus on "improvements", because you'll constantly fluctuate between being okay and unokay, and you'll take it personally. 

Just do the motions and eventually everything will fall into place. 

What we're personally going to understand is that these are challenges which everyone faces, no matter our upbringing or life experience.

Growing up with a loving, supportive family doesn't make heroin any less addictive or the crushing heart-break any less difficult.  

Instead, it's how we deal with these challenges that will define who we are. 

Because believe it or not, everyone feels worthless at the best of times and while their mental health may not necessary suffer, their excessive spending to feel good or lack of ambition may be just as bad. 

After all, we all live in the same crushing Western Society, with the same crushing expections, just like everyone else.

Except we're going to step up. 

We're going to become more functional and confident people, by examining the behaviours and unconscious choices we make on a daily basis. 

Oh, you'll be fine. 

Pervert. 

<!-- 



For example, I'm the kind of person who takes cold showers everyday. 

Now this doesn't change the fact that cold showers are entirely unbearable, however there's something about conscious "suffering" that opens  it's the mental perseverence that interests me

Though let's take a step back here for a second, and remove ourselves from the picture. 

Because at the end of the day, it's not about how we feel or think. 

We're tragic, dysfunctional human beings after all.

I mean, beautiful in a really fucked up, somewhat disfigured way, but for the most part that's not who we're aimming to be. 

Instead, let's focus on what the word sorry means to people who are confident and powerful. 

You know, the kind of people we are trying to emulate. 

The reality is that confident people don't say sorry for these exact reasons. 

Instead, they do a number of things which I'm going to highlight in the next section.

You know, so you can see an extra tile of my face. 

You pervert.



Which basically means you're probably going to die alone in a horrible car crash, if not due to my inability to prevent your fate. 

And please. Don't invite me to your funeral.
