<!-- The failures of thinking -->


Unadjusted people develop dumb habits. 

That's really what this blog is about: A foray into all the dumb habits, ideas and behaviours I developed as a child, and am now rectifying as an unadjusted adult.

In particular, I was somewhat obsessed with this notion of thinking as a child.

I developed this notion in my head that humans could overcome anything by thoroughly thinking it through.

And you know what, as a kid it sort of worked. 

Your insecurities were basic at best. You didn't need to worry incessantly about responsibility or addiction.

In my case, the only real cause for disappoint in life was when my mother would ban me from playing video games for months at a time. 

Even emotional and physical abuse is pretty whatever as a child. 

I mean, you're a kid. It's not like you know any better (I certainly didn't), so you end up internalising your experience as something normal. 

Of course, the problem with thinking as an idealisation is that it doesn't scale as you get older.

You develop addictions and crushes. The pressure of responsibility of life weighs on your ability to hold rational thoughts, and you break. 

Not to mention, the growing complexity of your emotions as you explore the wonderful world of drugs and heartbreak. 

So what we need is a different approach towards life. 

An approach where thinking plays a role, though not a predominant role, in assisting us with our success in life. 

This article hopes to explore and examine and weaknesses and strengths of thinking, as well as how we may have gotten it oh-so-wrong. 

In other words, why you were so fucking retarded. 

### Thinking Is An Organ

I think it might help if we focus on how we abuse thinking as a process.

As a basic definition, thinking is a process of reasoning.

It doesn't matter if you're ruminating about your ex or attempt to construct a narrative as you read a book - as long as you're reasoning with something, you're thinking.  

Ideally the aim of our thinking should be to reason with our topic in a logical, sensible way so that we can generate ideas and better understand what we're pondering. 

However like anything, thinking is a tool and all tools can and arguably will be abused, whether conscoiusly or unconsciously. 

In most cases, there are a few key ways in which we abuse thinking as a tool:

- We think in excess. (worry, anxiety)

- We think without purpose. (rumination, OCD)

- We think when shouldn't. (ignorance)

Some of these behaviours are coping mechanisms to deal with trauma. Others are simply dysfunctional traits we've inherited since childhood.

Another issue is that people simply don't understand any alternatives to thinking.

Thinking is all they know, and as the saying goes "If all you have is a hammer, everything will look like a nail".

Certainly, I have been culprit to all three - as I'm sure most people have, and it wasn't until later in life that I'd 

Of course, it was far too late by then. 

My obsession over my ex had already destroyed me, not to mention my insecurities as a human being. 

I think a large reason why I valued thinking is because of my smug, self-righteous aetheist beliefs as a child.

In this sense, thinking and "rationality" was my religion, which was completely impenetrable and always right.

As a result, I would never question the purpose of my overthinking as something potentially harmful - because in my eyes, they were conveying truth.

Rather than question what I was thinking, I merely believed that I was genuinely depressed and hopeless - because what alternative was there if my thoughts were right? 

In the end, a large part of my thinking contributed towards my depression.

What I didn't realise all along was 

To understand why, we need to dive into the limitations of thinking in terms of helping us achieve success in life, as well as understand the alternatives available to us.

### Thinking Is A Primitive Behaviour 

![You Are The Thought Butterfly](/img/blog/04-01.png)

Most people don't think right. 

That is to say, most people adopt a very linear way of thinking.


- an imperitive way of interpreting events. 

Imperitive means a sequential, step-by-step process of reasoning. 

The problem is that this doesn't scale well with complex problems. 

With imperitive thinking, people aim to micro-manage a chain of events like pieces of lego.

The issue is that our brains simply cannot process all this information at once. 

This becomes particular obvious when have to factor in our feelings, emotions, thoughts, expectations, as well as the reality of the situation. 

We become overwhelmed. We break down. 

Yet because of our believe in the power of thought, we continue to think and overthink, which evolves into anxiety, depression and 

For most people, thinking is no longer thinking. It is just a behaviour we produce as habit. 


Now there are a few solutions to our "thinking" problem; a new set of tools for us to manage our thoughts and lives in a way that's healthy. 


There are a few options:

- Scope out our thinking aka planning

- Think less. 










What may help is if we try to understand the limitations of thinking 



thinking made you intelligent, and that you could achieve anything by thinking it through.

Thinking is just a
