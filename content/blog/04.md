<!-- The failure of thinking -->
<!-- Thinking is one of the least effective coping mechanisms -->
<!-- Thinking is what dumb people do --> 

I've managed to develop a lot of dumb habits over the years. 

Stalking. Self-harm. Self-obsession. Addiction. Irrational idealisation.  

You name it. 

The kinds of habits developed by unadjusted people, because we don't seem to know any better. 

The cycle itself is fairly basic: 

The dumb habit is developed, we assume everything is horrible, and we deny all responsibility and control over the situation. 

We fuck up and crave some more. Absolutely delicious. 

One of these dumb habits of mine was developed quite innocently as a child. 

That dumb habit was thinking.

Thinking is obviously a loose term, however I suppose it means "thinking" in the traditional sense - using your brain to achieve something logically. 

You could be thinking about why your partner left you, judging that guy on the train for being super ugly, or even be reasoning with the narrative of a book you may or may not be reading.

It's all just... thinking. 

In particular, I was fixated on this notion that you could overcome anything in life by thoroughly thinking it through.

Mum being a total bitch? 

Oh right, I'm going to get in a really shitty mood and that's what's going to get me through it, because my brain is telling me yes and that's cool. 

Bla-zam! The kid's moved on.

Of course, I never said my thought processes as a child were particularly complex, nor reasonable. 

It didn't matter, because you know what? As a kid it sort of worked. 

Your insecurities were basic at best. Your emotions worked largely as you wanted them to, not to mention, produced results. 

Even emotional and physical abuse was somewhat manageable as a child. 

I mean, it's not like you know any better and even if you are aware, it doesn't change the fact that you're still a helpless, defenseless kid.

The abuse becomes part of your "well, this is life and feeling sad and being in denial is probably a reasonable coping mechanism, so I'm going to stick with it, not realising it's actually fucking me up" life experience. 

Because you're a kid and you can get away with this shit. 

It's not healthy, but it's not like society depends on your ability to funciton mentally at the age of 11.

The main issue with this approach however is that it doesn't scale as you become older.

The irrational emotional attachments you trusted your brain with can begin impact this thing called "responsibility" within your life. 

Your shitty behaviours can begin to impact on your ability to grow and learn. 

Getting angry or responding with judgement no longer solves your issues of debt or joblessness. 

All these things weigh upon your ability to function reasonably, and in response, we will usually continue being in denial and become a cry-baby of pain and depression. 

Oh, and let's not forget the wonderful world of drugs and heartbreak. 

Try thinking your way out of that bullshit. 

I mean, you hate her, but you also want to fuck her, and your stupid fucking brain can't decide what's less reasonable. 

The key issue for many of us is that we failed to develop more "appropiate" coping mechanisms to our problems.

So let's do something about it. 

Or rather, I write about it and you read about it and you probably do nothing about it, because these are just words, and that's cool too.

I'm sure we can figure something out.  

### Thinking: How We Abuse It  

![How We Abuse Our Thinking](/img/blog/04-01.png)

I suppose there are two main culprits when it comes to those who abuse thinking.

Firstly, there are those who give up completely - people who accept the fact that everything is fucked up and that there's no point trying to fight their brain to work. 

These are the kinds of people who not only wallow, but degredate. 

The type of people who end up eating store-bought lasanga for dinner everyday, because #lifechoices.

It is abuse by not thinking, or rather choosing not to think to potentially help themselves.

Alternatively, there are the fighters - people who will insistently fight their brain, almost always resulting in further mental illness.

Please don't be confused by the positive connotation. Fighters are no better than wallowers. 

These are the types of people who become incredibly self-critical, who develop judgemental mindsets and are fragile at the core. 

Rather than "let go" of the pain, fighters will continue to rationalise and compartamentalise the world, boxing themselves in like rats in a cage.

It is abuse by over-thinking. 

Although, there is also a third category:

Those who figure out that there's a balance between these two extremes. 

Those who understand that there is merit in not thinking, as well as thinking in moderation.

If you're not there yet, that's okay. 

We just need to work at it. 

In order to do this, we need to understand why our existing approach may be "unbalanced".  

To begin with, there is a massive misconception in society that thinking is some kind of productive idealisation of idea generation and intelligence.

And hell, with society's current obsession with maximising productivity, it's no wonder we're all so fucked. 

Perhaps it has something to do with this concept of the so-called "great thinkers" of our time, as those who incessantly thought like human typewriters beating down at lightning speed on human progress.

Hate to blow your bubble, but it's all bullshit. 

### The Three Pillars Of Thinking Abuse  

![The Three Pillars Of Thinking Abuse](/img/blog/04-02.png)

Here's a thought: Thinking itself is actually a burden.

It is a burden in the sense that it's a finite resource we have to expend, based on what little time and energy we have. 

This is to say that the less thinking we can do, the better, because it means we can conserve our energy to achieve more in the day.

It's the reason why self-critical and judegmental people, usually those obsessed with their insecurities, often feel battered or tired all the time.

It's just a massive abuse and waste of energy, to be able to function properly.

The truth is that most thought is purposeless and unproductive, in the sense that your energy is better spent not thinking in most scenarios. 

For example, thinking about how you can change your appearance based on the assumption of what you believe others think about you is unproductive. 

Also known keenly as insecurity, it serves no productive purpose. Not only is the problem trivial, however it's something that cannot deinitely be measured or solved. 

Okay, I'm sure your own personal problems are much worse than "worrying about what others think" but it's an easy example to demonstrate. 

Where we fail ourselves is by believing that all our thinking is actually genuinely trying to solve a problem. 

And the way we get away with it is by passively thinking, rather than actively thinking. 

The problem with relying solely on thinking as a tool is that when you repeat an action again and again for long enough, your brain will internal the process to no longer realise it's even doing that thing anymore. 

It is how our actions turn into behaviours, eventually becoming hard-to-nudge habits.

I'm sure it's a phenomenon you're aware of, like when you take the same route each day. 

Even though you've gone to all this effort to get there, it can feel as if you've somehow arrived at your destination seamlessly - as if your mind was somewhere else the whole time. 

And this is largely how all "dumb" habits are developed. 

We repeat these shitty behaviours frequently enough to the point of not realising that they're taking place.

Part of the reason is because we never learnt to question these thoughts.

This is understandable a child, because we simply didn't know any better and it becomes a learned behaviour into adulthood. 

With all this said, we can expand upon what has been written and identify some specific ways we abuse thinking:

- We think in excess (worry, anxiety)

- We think without genuine purpose (rumination, OCD)

- We think when we shouldn't (ignorance)

Later we will come back to these categories and explore how thinking can be used to positive effect - so we don't end up grabbing for another lasange in the freeze-food isle. 

For now however, let's take a detour into how we may have gotten ourselves into this mess. 

### How The Thinking Abuse Begins  

![How The Thinking Abuse Begins](/img/blog/04-03.png)

Arguably, most behaviours are developed as a result of childhood, which either progressively worsen or improve as a test to the foundations of our peers and parents.  

Please take note that the following is anecdotal. Take and apply what you will.

Ultimately, I would describe myself as a fighter.

I will wrangle and wrangle and wrangle and exhaust myself to the point of collapse, no matter how much it harms me, followed by depression, followed by even more wrangling - in a seemingly endless cycle. 

While there was often genuine thought involved, a large part of my thought comprised of self-criticism and judgement. 

The reason was simple: I was constantly judged by my mother as a child and it is something I internalised and trained to do on my own. 

Back-handed compliments were the norm. 

It was never "this is what you did well" it was always "this is what you could have done better".

It tendered me into a full-blooded cynic and it is a large part of reason why I'm so fucked. 

And unfortunately judgement is how most of us begin.

Because judgement, though seemingly benign, sort of works for its intended uses - and when you don't know better, you REALLY don't know better. 

So you judge yourself, it makes you feel like shit, which prompts you to try harder in order to feel better.

As a child, all you see (and often care about) are the results. 

Produce good results?

Well, it means mum doesn't remind you of what a completely worthless human being you are for another day, and that often overides the pain you self-create from trying to do something for the sake of pleasing someone else. 

It causes you to validate this behaviour as something that is not only effective, but healthy.

Healthy because it produces results - not because of the resounding insecurity that is being developed behind the scenes.

What happens is that your life becomes this intrepid balancing act of foolishness, as you try to manipulate your own emotions to do even the most basic of tasks. 

It is incredibly ineffective, and unfortunately for a lot of people, is all they know. 

Then as you internalise this behaviour, it grows into what I like to call the "judgemental mindset" where you feel the need to judge everything. 

Things not working out? 

Well obviously, it's beause you're not judging enough. 

And as you may tell, this simply spirals into judgement hell and is how many of us end up destroying ourselves through insecurity, depression, anxiety - as well as the rest of those abusive goodies. 

In other words, we hit such a low through all the destruction and self-criticism that we finally recognise the need to try something different. 

Some people never hit that low. 

They hold onto their beliefs of judgement forever, sinking into the bitterness of self-righteousness and suffering.

How they manage to hold onto all that hate and criticism is beyond me, though in some cases understandable. 

Another reason for my over-thinking can be attributed to my smug, self-righteous, aetheist beliefs as a child.

I was an instant skeptic from day one (maybe because of my treatment as child?) and in this sense, thinking and rationality were my religion. 

As a religion, it meant idolising thinking as something perfect; a process that was completely impenetrable. 

In my mind, thinking was always right, because in my eyes it was conveying truth, no matter how much pain and suffering it caused me. 

As a result, I would never question the over-thinking or the depression as something harmful. 

Rather, it validated my depression and hopeless because I saw no other alternatives. Not to mention, the self-fulfiling aspect of negative beliefs. 

So basically, I was fucked from the get go. 

And that's okay, because I've at least managed to partially unfuck myself, which is better than what it used to be. 

So let's move onto how we can unfuck ourselves, because I am absolutely in-love with the word unfuck. 

### Thinking As A Tool For Good

![Thinking As A Tool For Good](/img/blog/04-04.png)

In order to help us change, we need to start changing the way we think about thought. 

Earlier I remarked on the idea that thought is a burden - it is an action that takes up a large amount of time and energy to implement. 

In this sense, we need to start viewing thought as a tool - no different to a car or pencil. 

A tool to help us solve a problem or achieve our goals. In the context of this website, a tool to help us achieve success in life. 

Nothing more, nothing less. 

To do this we're going to focus on where thinking excels, as well as where it falls short in assisting us in our path towards success. 

Thinking itself is an intensive, linear process. 

This is to say that thinking works really well when we're trying to understand a limited number of sequential events - such as understanding mathematical logic, for example. 

It works well with these things because it is limited in scope, allowing us to micro-manage and configure at an intimate level that promotes understanding.

It helps us develop small conclusions, which helps us construct a bigger picture of our domain. 

This is what thinking does well at. 

Where thinking really sucks is when it comes to a) Assessing something subjective, like our emotions or b) Attempting to assess something on a complex, or large time-scale.

Why?

Because of the scope of the situation. Thinking is useful as a tool because it can help us come to verifiable conclusions. 

When you approach something that is both extremely complex and subjective, this no longer becomes the case. 

When there are too many possible answers, we can become overwhelmed and break down. 

This is where we must develop other skills to help us handle these situations.

In other words, plan our thinking. 

Planning is about recognising patterns and organising our thinking so it can be efficient, as well as view thing on a larger-scale.

While I won't go too in-depth into how to plan effectively, one basic strategy is to break things down into managable chunks, so we can think more effectively. 

Of course, this also brings us to another important aspect of thinking to our advantage: Not thinking at all.

For example, when trying to understand subjective like the reason behind why someone broke up with us, thinking itself can serve no purpose - no matter how much we try to plan it out. 

Instead, it can be much better to keep your mind calm and quiet, or on another level, engage in meditation.

Again, it's about finding the right tool for the job.

So to summarise, there are three different ways we can think about "thinking":

- Thinking (small scope)

- Planning (large scope)

- Meditation (not thinking)

With these three skills, we can more or less master our mind. 

I intend to write a lot more about these topics within the future, however the aim of this article was to focus on thinking as a starting point. I'll have a seperate article for both planning and meditation.

### Thinking Less: A Starting Point 

![Thinking Less: A Starting Point](/img/blog/04-05.png)

In a sense, this article is merely a pre-cursor for guiding you towards a number of crucial skills which will help you become successful and think more efficiently. 

At the very least, you are now a little more aware of the role thinking plays in your life, as well as the benefits it can provide.

Regardless, a good starting point is to simply think less.

You could be catching yourself in the middle of making a judgement, or simply realise that you're not thinking... when you're not thinking. 

It is only through this kind of self-awareness can we better undesrtand our behaviours, and slowly change them. 

If you're new to the whole self-awareness thing, I get that it's hard.

You're effectively activating a part of the brain you've never used before, but I promise it's just a matter of time and practice. 

Everyone is shitty in the beginning and even then, it took me years before I managed to hack it. 

Acceptance sometimes helps - accepting that there is no point in making judgements and that it serves no purpose to my success in life. 

So yeah. 

Thanks for reading my article! It means a lot to me :D



<!-- 

One reason we end up abusing it is by no longer consciously engaging in our thought. 

When we ruminate or maintain judgement for too long, we internalise it something normal and natural. 

This is particularly true as a child, as we assume that it's normal behaviour - rather than something self-created. 

As an extension of this sentiment, the other reason is ignorance. As children we simply don't know better - so we do what feels right. 

Let's only think when it serves us well, rather than rely on this behaviours as a one-size-fits-all solution to our problems. 

This article hopes to explore how thinking should ideally be used, alternatives to thinking, as well as how we may have gotten it oh-so-wrong. 

In other words, how to stop being retarded and use your brain properly. 


Now I don't blame you or myself for the abuse, because we simply lacked or failed to develop any alternatives in life. 

Instead of calming down our response, we instead learnt to shut down or increase the thinking beyond which was necessary.

One thing which was never truly taught, was meditation. 


- an imperitive way of interpreting events. 

Imperitive means a sequential, step-by-step process of reasoning. 

The problem is that this doesn't scale well with complex problems. 

With imperitive thinking, people aim to micro-manage a chain of events like pieces of lego.
