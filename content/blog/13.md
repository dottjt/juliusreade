I feel as if my drive for success has something to do with my mental illness.

Not necessarily in an inherently bad way (nothing is inherently bad, nor good), but that my obsession is driven by my inadequacies and insecurities. 

...rather than a kind of purity or kindness that perhaps only exists in the land of fairtales. 

Part of me feels as if I've been so traumatised as to be violently pushed towards a direction of success, rather than out of free-will. 

In the sense that perhaps my prior depression and irrationality was caused by my inability to become wildly successful, creating this insane and gullible monster that refused to believe otherwise. 

Well, obviously. 

I make no pretenses about why I'm here writing this blog, however as part of my mental illness - I also feel something incredibly noble in what I'm doing. 

Like a crusade galloping into a village of heretics, burning the place down without thought - it's simply what I've been programmed to do.

And I think it's a program I do well at, and which provides me with positive benefits - like not killing my own religiously-correct people via my uncollected exuberance.

I'm not well.

But I'm doing quite well. 

And that's all that matters, because even though part of me feels shrouded by guilt and shame and depression and all these awful things. 

I work towards managing them in a healthy way, and I think my pursuit for success is rather positive. 

Certainly, it was much better than the self-harm I perpetrated against myself - that helped absolutely no-one. 

And quite frankly, we as humans don't have a choice.

We must survive.  

### The Effects Of A Shitty Childhood

![The Effects Of A Shitty Childhood](/img/blog/12-01.png)

I didn't choose my shoes. 

Society did for me. 

Now I want you to picture a young, ambitious Julius. 

He's got a pretty fantastic face and he's being told he can achieve anything in life. 

Hell, that's the message I'm sure all of us recieved.

"Young Julius, you're incredibly smart. You have so much potential to achieve anything you want".

Not that Young Julius actually cares. He just wants to play video games, because unfortunately Young Julius is living in a paradox. 

The problem is that Young Julius was not told that you needed to work hard in order to achieve anything. 

Instead, I was under the impression that I was special. That I was just naturally better than everyone else. 

And in some senses, I was. 

And even if I wasn't, deep down inside I still thought I was. 

So from a young age, I believed that I was not only special, however I also didn't understand the value of hard work. 

Which meant I was bored a lot of the time, which made me cynical, and lead me to do stupid dopamine attracting shit like watch TV or masturbate to art magazine in my room.

It gets worse. 

Now imagine being told that you're not good enough. 

Everyday for the rest of your life.

By your single, dominant mother, the one sanctity of hope a child typically looks forward to. 

You can hear it in the tone of her voice, in her constant dismissal and backhanded compliments.

She never tells you what a wonderful job you've done. 

Instead, she tells you what you could have done better. 

And it eats away at you, to the point that you stop communicating. 

You don't feel safe to communicate yourself, because you feel judged. 

So you shut yourself away and become a pessimist. 

Through the constant judgement, you learn to judge yourself. 

You learn to hate yourself. 

And you know the worst part? 

When you pair being a pessimist with feeling like you're special... I don't know how you can create a more broken person.  

You can literally say goodbye to your life right there.

Because you won't have any normal friends, or even be able to sustain a relationship, because you're so idiotically twisted in your feigned superiority - that you will destroy everything good in your life. 

That's life.

Hopefully I've changed from that. 

### We Are A Product Of Society

The problem with Young Julius is that he's setup for failure.

He's driven for success through his false idealisation of himself, yet in reality he's a talentless schmuck who can barely understand why. 

That's who I am. 

It's the pallette I've been handed.

The problem is that people don't change.

I still get depressed and triggered for the very same reasons that I did ten years ago. 

The only difference is that I got smarter. 

Which means as I got older, I discovered more ways to medicate my inadequacy.

Man, I can't think of a single false hope I haven't attached to. 

I absolutely love pornography. There's something about that which makes me feel incredibly successful, if only temporarily. 

Gambling made me feel successful for a while, but I think part of me also knew it was quite stupid. 

Weed helped me forget everything, which is perhaps why it felt so good.

Yet the best medication has been to just do the thing and be successful. 

The side-effects I imagine aren't nearly as bad as smoking, and at the end of the day, it helps me in this capitalist society. 

Which I suppose brings me to the necessity of what I do all this:

Because I don't really have a choice. 

Part of me realises that my obsession is necessity. 

Life's hard. 

Managing a career is even harder. 

It's hard because it requires a lot of work, and as competition rises, it's only going to become more difficult.

I'm current in a position where I'm hoping to change career and as I'm working full-time, it means I must do whatever I can do make it happen. 



### We Are A Product Of Society

Part of me wishes I could be different. 

That I could just be normal and want and enjoy normal things. 

But I can't. 

I feel corrupted in my obsession. I'm literally always working or studying or reading and I wonder if I'm going insane. 

As time drifts by, I can't help but feel more and more detached from reality. 

I think I'm at the point where people no longer interest me. 

It's like I just don't... see value in them, when I could be studying. 

And to achieve what?

Well, hear me out buster and hopefully I can redeem myself. 

The truth is that I want children. 

I want three lovely, outstanding children. 

I don't know why, but it's what drives me to spend all my time studying and learning. 

I want to create a loving family, because I think it's something I never had growing up. 

My mother was awful and my eight bazillion shitty father figures weren't too stellar either. 

The other aspect is that I also disowned my entire family, so the desire is even stronger. 

I feel as if I'll be at peace once I have a family. 

You know, I'll have people to talk to and care for. 

Am I stupid for wanting this? Is it superficial? Is it biological? 

The plan is that by being an expert at X and Y I'll essentially be able to work from home and avoid the expensive costs of childcare etc.

Dun worry bout it. 

I've got it all planned and mapped out in my head.

Part of what makes the obsession addictive is progress. 

I can't stand not to wake up early in the .


Rather, I think it takes time I don't have.






The fact is that life's not fair. 

And I should feel grateful for what I have, even if 






I'm beginning to question this notion of mental illness and what exactly it means.
