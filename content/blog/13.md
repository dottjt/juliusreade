Self-awareness is fucking hard. 

There are two steps.

The first is learning to calm yourself down and actually be self-aware of the present moment. 

The second step is to figure out exactly what it is you need to be self-aware of and why it's important. 

It's very rare that you'll ever get the two. 

So that's what this article is about - increasing your chances towards becoming less retarded. Good luck, schmuck. 

### Your Stupid Brain

Here's the thing.

You're stupid. 

...and everyone else is too. 

We get bored. We stop giving a shit.

Remember: This is something we're all prone to. 




This is probably the philosophy I rely on the most.
