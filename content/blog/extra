I'm far from perfect, and neither are you too.

Everyone has problems and everybody suffers, even if they claim not to.

I suppose what I find interesting is how people try to mask/hide their problems, or perhaps even justify them - as if it was part of the plan all along. 

I personally do it by being open and exposing myself, so that no one else can hurt me. 

Yet that's not to say that the prospect doesn't terrify me.

It's intentional. 

In most cases, admitting to these problems severely contradicts the image which we all compare each other to - the imaginary, upholding citizen society would like to think is true...

...otherwise to collapse into complete anarchy, at the realisation that no one is really better than we are, including all those in authority. 

Oh wait, another politician caught for child pornography? How quaint.  

But of course, as per society policy, we believe the shame of a admitting that we're wrong far outweights the shame of knowing that we're crumbling pieces of shit. 

I'm no different. 

The pre-text here is that in order to overcome addiction, you need to adopt a different mindset of who you are, so you can truly tackle the person within. 


That is, the addict who wants nothing more than to virtually masturbate all over your face, and rip your kidney's out for profit.
