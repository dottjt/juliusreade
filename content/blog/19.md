I didn't grow up religious. 

And as a result of this, I've developed a blatant disregard for how religious humans really are.

Which has inadvertently lent towards my myraid of mental health issues.

Put simply, religion is important, because religion is everything.

It is what defines our understanding of the world, as well as our behaviours and beliefs. 

Where most people go wrong is in believing that religion is defined by faith. 

Specifically, faith defined by some form of god. 

Which a lot of use to demonise and misconstue religion as some form of evil. 

Rather than a medium through which we all attempt to understand the world. 

Because religion has very little to do with organised faith.

Rather, it's defined by our beliefs - something every single one of us have in common.

Many of us need to seperate religion from the common widespread institutions which try to 'claim' it.

Though interestingly enough, whether you believe in an organised, 

We still relate to our beliefs in the same way. 

Much like how Christians build churches to spread and congregate their faith.

Everyone does a very similar thing with our beliefs, worshipping and glorifying the ideas in our mind.  

To begin our understanding, I want us to focus on this idea of the temple. 

And how it relates to every single one of us, regardless of our faith or lackthereof. 

An idea which most of us completely disregard. 

However once we understand how we build and create temples in our mind, we can explain a lot of behaviours and irrational thoughts.

As well as control what we believe and feel about ourselves. 

### What Is A Temple?
![What Is A Temple?](/img/blog/19-01.png)

On a very basic level, temples are places of worship. 

They are places for us to cherish and embrace, the ideas which we hold to be true. 

In other words, they are places for us to cultivate and develop our beliefs. 

We all have thousands of different temples in our mind.

Each one of them, a reflection of our beliefs and what we find important in life.

Some of these temples are quite large. Others are quite small.

Many simply don't exist because they haven't entered our mind.

Such as our temple for 2nd century literature on peanut farming. 

The size (and existence) of our temple depends on how much time and effort we spend cultivating and embrace them. 

Which brings me to my second point. 

What's important to note is that these temples aren't pre-existing structures.

Beliefs don't just appear out of thin air. 

They're constructed. 

We construct these temples.

We construct and reinforce them with our thoughts, our time and our worship. 

We reinforce them each time we feel a sense of insecurity, or even a moment of happiness. 

We develop them and support them, not only with our words, however also with our experience. 

Most people don't realise this.

Most people don't understand that temples/beliefs are self-created structures, that we personally harvest and create.

And as an extension of this, they also don't understand that these temples can just as easily be dismantled.

As they can be created.  

And this is where most people fail with their mental health. 

### Worshiping The Wrong Temple
![Worshiping The Wrong Temple](/img/blog/19-02.png)

The aim of this article is to help you better understand how we create these temples of belief.

As well as how to dismantle them. 

Ultimately like all things in life, the medium isn't the problem.

Temples can be empowering, just as they can be equally destructive. 

What's important is our ability to control them, and construct and deconstruct them at our will.

Which unfortunately, doesn't come naturally.

But through practice. 

And like most things in life, we won't bother to learn something until life becomes utterly unbearable.

i.e. construct a temple that ruins our life. 

For example, many of us construct temples to do with our self-worth or based on the expectations we have of reality. 

We can create temples based on relationships, or faulty paradigms. 

Personally speaking, I'd created this incredible temple during my first relationship. 

And once that relationship had ended, I didn't quite know how to respond.

Of course, I'd considered my temple to be a source of truth, so I refused to let go of our relationship in my mind.

Not realising that the temple was merely a fabrication in my mind, not based in reality.

The scary thing about these kinds of temples, is that we often don't even realise we've created them. 

We enjoy the feeling of worshipping these temples so much, that we completely neglect the process that went into constructing them in the first place.

Making us feel utterly clueless as to how we should respond, once we realise how destructive it is to our lives. 

It is the reason why addictive behaviours can be so destructive. 

We can become so encapsulated in what we are feeling and experiencing, that we completely neglect the process involved. 

Not only distancing ourselves from the actions causing our addiction, however leaving us in denial about how we feel. 

Of course, this is only the beginning 

### Temples Are Tough Business
![Temples Are Tough Business](/img/blog/19-03.png)

Temples are hard.

But they're not impossible. 

The first thing to understand about temples is that we have complete control over them. 

Which is to say that we have complete control over our beliefs.

The problem most of us face is that our temples are designed to be worshipped.

Not to be destroyed. 

And when we build a temple so large, and so influential in our mind.

It can feel impossible to dismantle.

Naturally in building our temple, we created guards and defense measures to ensure it's safety. 

Often not even consciously. 

When we invest in our temple, we invest in the behaviours and feelings that our temples promote.

And this is what gives them power.

In dismantling our temple, what we are truly saying is that we want to return that power to ourselves. 

Where we don't feel obligated to believe in on particular thing. 

This also explains why it can be so difficult to construct new temples.

For example, when we start a new routine or perhaps even a new hobby.

It's because there is no pre-existing temple, and so all the support, hope and 


Instead, it needs to come from other means. 

It needs to come from hard work, imagination and ambition - things which temples do not provide. 

This is often why I spout the merits of routine, because it can help us solidify the process of building helpful temples. 



### Dissolving Our Temples
![Dissolving Our Temples](/img/blog/19-04.png)

There are two things which usually tend to help.

First, we want to find ways in which we can distance ourselves from our temples. 

This usually means not taking our feelings, emotions and thoughts personally.

In essence, this means understanding that while these things feel real, they are merely indicators.

Rather than a source of truth as our mind is trying to tell us. 

-- link to our emotions are an elaborate lie --



The other good news is that it doesn't have to happen overnight.

Each time you chip away or think less about your temple than the day before, is one step closer .

Often it's not about making big agreements.

By making many small agreements we can slowly dissolve many of the negative aspects in our life. 

More simply, first we have actions, then we form habits, which ultimately become beliefs.



Secondly, we also want to at the same time, to construct a much more forgiving and healthy temple for us to worship. 

A temple based in hard work and kindness. Anything that empowers you to want to become a better person. 

Or at the very least, not hating yourself or feeling worthless about yourself. 

It could be an ambition, or something you want to aciheve. 

This part is crucial, because it's transfering our time and energy into developing something more positive.

Often where people will go wrong is that they will overcome their addiction, only to realise they have nothing else to go to.

Merely repeating the cycle and returning to their bad habits. 




### A Life Without Temples?
![A Life Without Temples?](/img/blog/19-05.png)

Ideally however, we should not rely on our temples.

Which is to say that we shouldn't necessarily commit to any beliefs. 

Or expectations or assumptions about reality. 

Unfortunately, life is not free, so this is more-or-less impossible.

It is what monks aim to do, but obviously they still rely on donations to survive - making it a somewhat futile endeavour for most of us.

Certainly, positive temples have their place in life. 

More importantly however, being able to control how and when you create your temples is much more important.
