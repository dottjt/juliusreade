Unwrapping The Mystery That Is Choice And Self-Control
Opportunity 
Misnomer
Opportunity is not a choice. It's a pathway.

The brain is a tricky thing in that it's conceptual. 

Meaning that you can't just tell the brain something and expect it to understand.

You have to describe your message in a language that your brain can understand. 

Which really is to say that our brains relate and react to some concepts better than others.

Take for example a circle.

A circle is a concept most of us can relate to. It's something most of us are familiar with, can visually recognise and make sense of. 

In a sense, a circle is like a sort of brand name that is synonymous through-out all cultures. 

What makes the circle so brilliant is that it's almost like a fundamental concept that we can use to build others. 

If we group circles together we can form images, not to mention all the other objects which conceptually relate to circles, such as wheels, cans and even the general shape of a face. 

That's the circle. 

On the other end of the spectrum of conceptual unfuckery, there's an infinitely recurring, five-dimensional object. 

Even though it's technically an object that can be described and even partly visualised, for most people it's a concept that goes well beyond our brain's ability to process. 

I have no idea what one looks like, and it has zero relation to any of the other concepts in my head. 

It's a dead idea in my mind, even though I'm sure it's vitally important to the success of the human race in some way. 

I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that in the context of understanding and communication, conceptual complexity isn't superior to simplicity.

They're merely different things, and that's an important concept to understand when we're trying to sort ourselves. 

Understandably when we get stuck in a rut, it can seem very complex and surely, we end up making it more complex than needs be. 

However often it's better to relate to simple concepts, rather than more complex ones, in order to better understand what is going on.

Don't try and understand a sphere in the context of an infinitely recurring, five-dimensional object.

It doesn't make you smarter, it merely overcomplicates your problems which then spills into your perception of what you believe your problems to be. 

Just use a damn circle. 

Because at the end of the day, the only thing our brain cares about is working within concepts and ideas it's familar with, rather than foreign to. 

And besides, there are much more effective ways to increase your intelligence than through battling mental illness and your self-identity. 

Aaaaaaaand this is where our discussion on choice begins. 

### Choice Is An Inifinitely Reoccurring Loop 

![Choice Is An Inifinitely Reoccurring Loop](/img/blog/07-01.png)

Much like our infinitely recurring, five-dimensional object, this idea of choice is as equally confusing, as it is bewildering.

So much so to the point of paralysis. 

As you can tell, I'm not a big fan of this idea of choice, and this is the part where I explain why. 

Not only is "choice" highly contextual, however it's an idea that differs radically from individual to individual. 

Some people feel as if they have no choice, perhaps due to their mental illness or hopeless circumstances, while others can view these very same things as an opportunity for change. 

Depending on your perspective and experience in life, choice can have completely different meanings - which is to suggest that it's a concept that lacks consistency. 

Unlike a circle, which is roughly similar throughout all cultures. 

In fact, it's the reason this idea of "freewill" is debated so frequently, and is a core idea within religion itself. 

It's the reason we keep having all these pointless religious wars, in which one party argues that their infinitely recurring, five-dimensional object is more accurate than their infinitely recurring, five-dimensional object. 

The point being, this idea of choice is still a clusterfuck of an idea and for a lot of us, we're no yet closer to understanding what it actually means.

Take modern society for example.

Many of us still have commitment issues, anxiety, delusion - all as a result of trying to rationalise with this idea of choice. 

Ever been paralysed by the amount of choice you have in life and don't quite know what to do?

Well obviously. 

Welcome to the Western world *wink*. 

I suppose what I mean to say is that this idea of choice offers very little in the way of meaningful insight into how we should live our lives. 

Yes, it's an idea that seems vital in terms of securing our future success - however that is the illusion that is holding us back.  

From decisions, to eventual outcomes, our initial choice seems to be that crucial first step towards achievement. 

And yet regardless of all the positive choices we may make, we still continue to relapse, give up on our ambitions and stop caring for ourselves to the point of lovely depression.

Because maybe, just maybe, we've been looking at choice the wrong way. 

When in actual fact, choice is a meaningless question, sort of like asking why. 

Understandably both choice and asking why are fascinating questions, however in the context of function and success serve little purpose. 

Rather, it's a shitty narrative, and one I hope to change for the better. 

So fuck you infinitely recurring, five-dimensional object.

Circles are so much cooler.  

### Why We Obsess Over Choice

![Why We Obsess Over Choice](/img/blog/07-01.png)

Let's take a step back here.

What we ultimately want to undesrtand is why many of us obsess over these ideas of choice and freewill. 

Why do we find these things so utterly important to the point that we allow it to make us depressed? What can we possibly hope to discover?

In part, I believe this obsession derives from this thing called productivity. 

Broadly speaking, it's a drive for self-improvement. 

We want to be happier, have more money, have more time, have the best everything - and many of us believe that the only way to achieve these things is through choice. 

Because conceptually opposite to choice is to have no choice, no opportunity, no money, no time - which we equate to death. 

Instead, we want more choice. More life. More opportunity. 

The problem is that choice doesn't mean anything, and has little relation to obtaining these things. 

You see, the problem is that people stop at choice. 

They believe making positive choices is enough for them to have these things, only to end up overwhelmed with depression and hopelessness. 

In the process of believing in choice so highly, they forgot something very important:

Foresight. 

They didn't truly think about where this choice would leave them. 

They merely made the choice and then shut off their brain, like everything was going to be okay.

In this pursuit for choice, what they didn't realise was what they actually desired was self-control.

Because at the end of the day, we already have choice. We are already alive and smart and capable. 

In fact most of us in the Western world have so much choice like you cannot imagine. 

The problem is that we're not aware of it, because we never learned the discipline.

While discipline and self-control are topics that probably deserve their own article, there's something much more powerful that will help you appreciate those concepts further. 

<!-- Article on discipline and self-control -->

And I think I might have the answer. 


### We Don't Need Choice. We Need Pathways

![We Don't Need Choice](/img/blog/07-01.png)

One thing I've noticed in my day-to-day life is that I don't think much.

In fact, the only time I tend to think is when I'm verging on relapse, which is to say that I generally have the self-control not to think most of the time. 

Instead, I'm learning, reading, writing and focusing on the things that are important to me. 

I think part of the reason is that I'm certain in my actions. 

I have no doubt or fear in regards to my commitment towards life, which means I don't need to endlessly question what I'm doing. 

And then I realised:

It's because I think in terms of pathways, rather than choice. 

This idea of pathways is really cool and I'm something I'm incredibly excited to share with you today.

A pathway is like a framework of choice. 

Rather than view our decisions individually, a pathway essentially maps out the outcomes of the individual choices we make, so that we don't have to bother ourselves with the small details. 

And when you no longer have to worry about the small things, you no longer have doubt or anxiety in what you're doing or why. 

Because you already know why. You already know what the outcome is, and it's incredibly empowering. 



The main issue pathways addresses is our lack foresight into how our actions affect our future.

It's the reason we get discouraged during uni. It's the reason we give up halfway into our pursuit for success.

It's because we don't know how our effort is contributing towards our goal.

In the beginning, you're going to want to be quite specific with what you want to achieve.

You have to tell yourself that in three months time, you expect to be 




Why it's always hard starting out

- confusion



The thing I love about pathways is that it can be incredibly vague, as long as you know you're heading in the right direction. 

In my particular case, I'm obsessed with programming and I want to become a professional programmer.

I know that all I have to do is spend at least four hours each day programming, and within the next three years I will have the skills to become a professional programmer. 

End of story. 

Of course, for you it will be much different, because this is the end-goal narrative you create once you do develop the passion and discipline for what you want to achieve.

In the beginning  




I don't worry about what I'm learning. 


Of course, my narrative is actually a lot simplier than that:

I know that if I spend all my free-time learning and that I try my best at everything, I do I will eventually get ahead and achieve my goals. 

The beautiful thing about having something so simple is that it a

I think part of the problem in trying to rationalise choice is that it leads us towards asking the wrong questions.

Because let's be honest: The only reason we ever contemplate choice is to gain more choice. 








### A Framework For Choice?

The fact is that everyone has a choice in life.

The problem is that this choice
