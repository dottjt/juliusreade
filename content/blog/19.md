I didn't grow up religious. 

Well, I did. 

But I certainly didn't grow up believing in any of it. 

In particular, I never quite understood the compulsion for people to believe.

All I could comprehend was how silly their beliefs were, rather than understand the bigger picture of their religious experience. 

Though perhaps that's what made it so dangerous. 

While I knew of their beliefs, I didn't quite get to drink from that exquisite chalice that made them drunk. 

And embrace myself in that feeling of religion. 

Which in essence, made me more susceptible to being influenced by religion later on in life. 

In all it's light and darkness. 

And in a lot of ways, that's what happened. 

I found myself being transformed by my beliefs and ideas more intensely later in life. 

Disguised as something completely unfamiliar and ravishing. 

On a personal level, substituting prophets with the woman in my life, almost recreating an agnostic version of the bible to complete my understanding of the world.

While I've thankfully dissolved all that, today I would like to write about why. 

Because when you think about it, religion is everything.

It's what defines our understanding of the world, as well as our behaviours and beliefs. 

It doesn't really matter what we believe - we are all still confined to the hope and delusion which manifests from our undying curiosity to understand ourselves, and the world around us. 

Where I believe people like myself go wrong, is in believing too intensely in this idea of truth. 

That one religion must inherently be better than another, based on the facts it aims to represent. 

In my case, believing that my agnostic beliefs were superior above all. 

When by definition, faith doesn't attempt to be anything more than a mere notion of hope and worship.

And in an ultimate twist of irony, this search for 'truth' draws you towards becoming even more religious than the people you criticise. 

Not as a means to discredit others.

But to reinforce what we believe about ourselves. 

It is a perpetual cycle of tyranny and something that I would argue, is entirely unavoidable. 

### What Is A Temple?
![What Is A Temple?](/img/blog/19-01.png)


To begin our understanding, I want us to focus on this idea of the temple. 

And how it relates to every single one of us, regardless of our faith or lackthereof. 

As I'm sure we're all aware, certain faiths construct churches to spread and congregate their faith.

And in a sense, we all do the same thing in our minds, in regards to our ideas and beliefs. 

We worship certain beliefs and ideas, as well as glorify (or demonise) them. 

To bring it back to a very basic level, temples are places of worship. 

They are places for us to cherish and embrace the ideas which we hold to be sacred. 

In other words, they are places for us to cultivate and develop our beliefs. 

And when you think of the mind as a structure, we all have thousands of different temples.

Representing different ideas and beliefs. 

Each one of them, a reflection of our understanding and what we find important in life.

Some of these temples are quite large and influential.  

Others are quite small, meaning they have less influence on our behaviours and actions. 

Many simply don't exist, because we have yet to think of them. 

For example, our seemingly non-existent temple on 1st Century peanut farming. 

It probably just... won't ever happen. 

The size (and existence) of our temple depends on how much time and effort we spend cultivating and embracing them. 

Which brings me to my second point. 

What's important to note is that these temples aren't pre-existing structures.

Beliefs don't just appear out of thin air. 

They're constructed. 

We construct these temples.

We construct and reinforce them with our thoughts, our time and our worship. 

We reinforce them each time we feel a sense of insecurity, and in every blink that subconsciously defines our experience.

We develop them and support them, not only with our words, however also with our mental aptitude. 

They are an extension of us and how we think. 

And not having an understanding of this is where a lot of people go wrong with their mental health. 

Not today.  

### Worshiping The Wrong Temple
![Worshiping The Wrong Temple](/img/blog/19-02.png)

It is important to understand how we construct (and worship) these temples in our mind.

Because they can explain a lot about the behaviours and irrational thoughts we exhibit on a daily basis.

In addition once we master this process, we can control what we believe, as well as how we feel about ourselves. 

So why do people struggle so much in this regard? 

Often, this is by design. 

Something we'll get into in this article. 

I suppose the aim of this article is to help you better understand how we create these temples of belief.

As well as how we can dismantle them. 

Ultimately like all things in life, the medium isn't the problem.

Temples can be empowering, just as they can be destructive. 

What's important is our ability to control them, and construct and deconstruct them at our will.

Which like all things, is something you learn with time - no different to creating beliefs.

And like most things in life, is something most of us won't get around to until completely necessary.

i.e. construct a temple that ruins our life. 

For example, many of us construct temples to do with our self-worth, or which are based on false expectations of reality.

Temples based on relationships that aren't what they seem, or on paradigms of addiction which merely hold us ransom to our senses. 

Personally speaking, I'd constructed this incredible temple during my first relationship. 

Which by design, was greater than anything else I'd ever constructed (welcome to the land of love). 

And once that relationship had ended, I didn't quite know how to respond.

My feelings of leaving were conflicting with this temple/belief I'd constructed in my mind, which represented our relationship as the greatest thing ever devised. 

To the point that I'd considered my temple to be a source of truth, preventing me to let go of her in my mind.

Even though she wasn't physically there in my life. 

Not realising that my temple was nothing more than a fabrication.

Of course, as humans are inherently religious creatures, often find it difficult to distinguish between the two. 

Which is what leads us to delusion and denial, in an attempt to cope with our distress. 

It is why deconstructing these temples can feel as if we are losing an inherent part of ourselves. 

Because we are essentially destroying the structure that we spent so long supporting. 

And is the reason why most people never move on, because they find that pain too difficult to bear. 

Which is funny, because none of it is 'real' and the pain is merely pre-conceived. 

### Temples Are Tough Business
![Temples Are Tough Business](/img/blog/19-03.png)

Temples are hard.

But they're not impossible. 

The first thing we must understand about temples/beliefs is that we have complete control over them. 

The problem most of us face is that our temples are designed to be worshipped.

Not to be destroyed.

We design them to be a one-way negotiation, rather than something we can truly connect with. 

The scary thing about these kinds of temples, is that we often don't even realise we've created them. 

We enjoy the feeling of worshipping these temples so much, that we completely neglect the process that went into constructing them in the first place.

In fact, we become so desperate that design these these temples will all kinds of traps and defenses in order to ensure that they cannot be destroying. 

Making us feel utterly clueless as to how we should respond, once we realise how destructive they have become to our lives. 

This is the monster we must address.

Naturally in building our temple, we created guards and defense measures to ensure it's safety.

This is how most of us usually construct them, provided that the only time people usually construct temples is in times of need and desperation. 

Which is also to say that this is the right and wrong way to construct our temples. 

Temples should be places of understanding and change, not of dictatorship.

Furthermore, temples should not aim to replicate truth.

Instead, they should be a reflection of the processes and behaviours in our life, rather than on belief. 

While beliefs are important - they don't necessarily facilitate anything to the extent that processes do. 

Of course, you could also argue that we shouldn't glorify our beliefs at all - but again, I would argue that's unavoidable.

So you may as well construct something benign. 

When we invest in our temple, we invest in the behaviours and feelings that our temples promote.

And this is what gives them power.

In dismantling our temple, what we are truly saying is that we want to return that power to ourselves. 

Where we don't feel obligated to believe in on particular thing. 

This also explains why it can be difficult to construct new temples.

For example, when we start a new routine or perhaps even a new hobby.

It's because there is no pre-existing temple, and so it's like building a foundation from scratch. 

Instead, it needs to come from other means. 

It needs to come from hard work, imagination and ambition - things which temples do not provide. 

This is often why I spout the merits of routine, because it can help us solidify the process of building helpful temples. 

Through that initial temple you build from embracing routine itself. 

### Dissolving Our Temples
![Dissolving Our Temples](/img/blog/19-04.png)

There is a second aspect to this that I haven't quite covered.

And that is the aspect of worship. 

In order to dissolve our temples, we must first identify how we worship them to begin with.

This is often the most difficult step, because the way in which we worship is all completely inidividual. 

And when we believe in something so intensely, we can fail to understand how exactly we're reinforcing these structures. 

Not only due to the resistance in trying to understand. 

But because these temples have usually been constructed out of denial, it can be difficult to even try understand at all. 

For better or worse, this is a process that can take years.

Literally, years. 

But put it this way, nothing easy was ever worth doing. 

First, we want to find ways in which we can distance ourselves from our temples. 

This usually means not taking our feelings, emotions and thoughts personally.

In essence, this means understanding that while these things feel real, they are merely indicators.

Rather than a source of truth as our mind is trying to tell us. 

-- link to our emotions are an elaborate lie --



The other good news is that it doesn't have to happen overnight.

Each time you chip away or think less about your temple than the day before, is one step closer .

Often it's not about making big agreements.

By making many small agreements we can slowly dissolve many of the negative aspects in our life. 

More simply, first we have actions, then we form habits, which ultimately become beliefs.



Secondly, we also want to at the same time, to construct a much more forgiving and healthy temple for us to worship. 

A temple based in hard work and kindness. Anything that empowers you to want to become a better person. 

Or at the very least, not hating yourself or feeling worthless about yourself. 

It could be an ambition, or something you want to aciheve. 

This part is crucial, because it's transfering our time and energy into developing something more positive.

Often where people will go wrong is that they will overcome their addiction, only to realise they have nothing else to go to.

Merely repeating the cycle and returning to their bad habits. 


### Master Your Temple
![Master Your Temple](/img/blog/19-05.png)

Certainly, I am of the belief that experiencing (and perhaps overcoming) religion is unavoidable.

Largely, because it's something you first need to experience in order to identify.

Yet often it's game over once you've experienced it. 

In an ideal world we should not rely or construct on our temples at all. 

And certainly, living without notion or expectation is something a lot of us. 

Of course, most of us don't have this kind of luxury in the modern world - which means the strategic use of temples is the next best thing. 

Which is to say that we shouldn't create temples based in overwhelming belief. 

Or necessarily even commit to any beliefs at all. 

Certainly, temples that empower us have their place in life. 

However as long as you have the ability to control your temples, rather than have them control you 

Then you can go very far in life.

It doesn't matter what religion people believe in.

Quite frankly, I don't even think religion itself gives a shit.

What matters is understanding this idea of faith. 

And how it moulds into our interpretation of reality, as well as our understanding the world around us. 

As a medium through which we all attempt to understand the world. 

Because religion has very little to do with organised faith.

Instead, religion is defined by our beliefs - something every single one of us have in common.

The trick is in seperating religion from the common widespread institutions which try to 'claim' it.

Because a lot of us can get caught up in anger created from identifying other people's beliefs. 

When it completely misses the mark on understanding our own spirituality. 

Regardless of what we believe, we all still relate to our beliefs in the same way.
