+++

The aim of this article is to help you come to terms with your depression. 

Ummmm, say what?

Don’t fret, you lucky puck.

I promise it won't involve intense emotional gouging, followed by hours of soul-destroying questioning of your precious most-inner thoughts.

Except that it probably will, so stay tuned. 

As you can imagine, depression is a heavy topic with a lot of thorny edges poking at the sides. 

Which is why this article won't focus on a number of topics that are vital to understanding depression. 

Such as how to commit towards recovering, creating motivation, delegating positive agreements, blah blah. 

Those are topics that I will cover in seperate articles, if only because my fingers are limited to how much they can write. 

<!-- Commitment is the only thing that matters.  -->

<!-- Understanding what motivates you (and them).  -->

Instead, what this article will primarily focus on is presenting you with a simple framework which will allow you to better understand your depression.

An effective framework for you to learn and build upon, which will enable you to obtain a very basic and micro point of view of your depression. 

...which in my opinion, is an excellent starting point for those serious about tackling their mental health. 

Of course, please understand that it's a method that cannot stand on it's own. 

It requires significant additional context in order to be effective, which I will eventually write about, as mentioned earlier. 

All I can say for now, as I prepare my fingers for the delicious text ahead, is that if you stick with it, you'll eventually be able to stop feeling depressed altogether.

Which is pretty cool. Maybe even sexy.

Though baby steps, yeah? 

It’s hard enough when you can barely wake up in the morning, so I'm not asking you to go out and eliminate poverty.

Not to mention, it takes years. 

No different to becoming fluent at anything else in life, whether it be a language or a sport. 

While depression may not an easy topic to grasp, I believe this is a reflection of the lack of intuitive explanations currently available on the internet.

Put simply, my job is trick your brain into believing I'm right.

...based on how I managed to trick myself into believing there's merit in being a functional human being.  

Which I'm sure you crave on some very primal level, or otherwise would not be reading this article. 

So let's begin. 

### Asking The Wrong Questions

![Asking The Wrong Questions](/img/blog/08-01.png)

<!--
So much so, that I'll pretend not to be depressed so that people won't ask. 

You get it. I get it. Well, of course you get it. I know you do.
 -->

Chances are you've partaken in the hilarious dynamic of having another person comment, or perhaps enquire into why you look like a complete emotional wreck. 

« So Julius, ummm… y u so sad? y u sadie tear eyes? » 

...and in the immediate struggle that ensues, you contemplate explaining some horrible fact about your life (which of course, you're currently trying to suppress).

Or explain why they're actually an asshole, because it's none of their business and please, if you could just back off, that would be wonderful. 

Instead, you prompt to mutter an elementary "I don't know" and next thing you know, you've escaped into the nearest closet to avoid any further confrontation.

Yet despite how much it annoys us when others question our feelings, it's a conversation we continue to pursue within our own head when we're alone. 

You know, as if we're somehow more qualified than the person next to us.

So we sit there, usually alone, and we think. 

We pick apart every single detail in our head, searching for an answer that we feel entirely incapable, nor prepared of answering.

And yet despite how hopeless it makes us feel, we also feel as if we have no choice but to pursue the emotional and intellectual grind. 

All because we've created and committed to this stupid agreement in our head that we're the only ones capable of helping ourselves. 

Commonly known as rumination, it doesn't work, it doesn't provide any meaningful insight into our depression and it's a complete disaster that causes us to collapse further into our jelly-like state. 

So let's try to understand why. 

A lot of people tend to view rumination as a form of trying, which they equate with effort, which they further equate with solving problems. 

Which makes sense logically in our head, but fails to deliver due to the fallacy that effort scales to producing valid outcomes i.e. solutions to our depression. 

I mean, if it were truly that simple, no one would have any problems. 

Of course, this isn't to say that we shouldn't question our thoughts or feelings.

It merely emphasises **the importance of asking the right questions**, as opposed to misleading questions, which naturally lead to misleading answers, which serve only to strengthen our depression and mental illness.

Unfortunately, and the reason why rumination doesn't work, is that our depression causes us to ask the wrong questions by design. 

It skews our focus inwards and towards ourselves, rather than on the big picture of our life and our depression. 

Which primarily leads to asking the question of why.

Why we feel depressed. 

Why we hate ourselves.

Why our life sucks.

Why we can't seem to get laid, despite our rigid good looks and exquisitely sexy eyebrows. 

Well, as it turns out, these questions have been misleading us all along.

### Constructing A Coherent Narrative

![Constructing A Coherent Narrative](/img/blog/08-02.png)

Part of the problem with asking the question of 'why' is that it fails to provide us with a cohesive narrative for us to make sense of. 

Narrative is important because it's what allows us to connect with our thoughts and ideas.

In essence, creating clarity in our lives and allowing us to develop hope, motivation and ambition.

Awesome.

Part of the problem in asking the question of why in the context of this narrative, is that there are thousands of potential reasons why.

...which we try to piece together into some coherent narrative, which inevitably ends up as this glob of irrational baloney.

You know, because she hates me, because she's too afraid to love me, because she doesn't know what she's talking about, because she's lying, because she's crazy, because she's pretending not to care, because she's in denial, because she's on drugs, because she doesn't know how to communicate her feelings, because she's...

And then when you take into account our own feelings and emotions, you're basically left with a pile of burnt fairy dust.

Emotional splatter. 

Ultimately, we end up creating narratives which conclude that we are hopeless, and that we are entirely incapable as human beings. 

Hopeless by design, because of the kinds of misleading questions our depression begs of us to ask.

Which extends to developing shitty, somewhat retarded narratives that make no sense. 

Yet the funny thing is that I think part of us knows that our narratives suck, and yet because we're so desperate, we feel as if we have no choice but to continue to constuct and tinker.

In a sense, building this god complex within ourselves, which I believe develops into obsession and narcissism.   

Of course, there's a better way. 

Instead, I am going to introduce you to a different way of thinking about your depression, that fundamentally changes the types of questions we ask ourselves.

A method which approaches depression with a plot in mind. 

It's a simple, whole new way of understanding our depression, that doesn't trap us into these meaningless cycles. 

### How

![How](/img/blog/08-03.png)

Here's what we're going to do. 

Instead of asking why we’re depressed, we're instead going to ask **how we get depressed**. 

Why we get depressed?

No.

How we get depressed?

Yes. 

While it may seem like an insignificant change in thinking, asking questions from this point of view radically changes not only our definition of what depression is, but also how we can relate to our own emotions and feelings.

It's truly incredible once you understand why:

Humans are inherently curious creatures, driven to explore and endlessly question the world around us, in an attempt to uncover, improve and satisfy our own lives...

\*Insert Epic Monologue\*

...yet despite the vast knowledge we have of the world and the universe at large, we still have no idea why things are the way they are. 

We don’t understand why the universe began, why the speed of light travels at a constant, why we can't achieve equality, amongst the millions of other questions our species has pondered. 

Largely as it turns out, because none of these questions matter. 

Because what truly matters is the question of how. 

Only by understanding how something works, can we manage to apply it to our lives. 

For example, we don’t need to know why gravity is a fundamental force of nature, in order to know that if we jump from the top of a tall tree, that we're probably going to be in for a bad time. 

Put another way, the why isn’t important because it doesn't provide us with insight into how something functions. 

...or perhaps from a different angle, you could say that we must first understand how something works, before we can understand why it works. 

In order to do this for our own purposes, we must focus on the process, rather than the meaning behind the process. 

That is to say, the process of depression. 

(In fact, everything is a process, and can be broken down into a series of processes.)

And once you understand this, completely changes the way you think about depression.

Oh, and you know the best thing about processes? 

Processes are entirely predictable. 

Yep. 

You bet your ass they are, and that's what makes them so damn powerful. 

Remember, understanding why something happens does not provide us with insight to control it. 

Only by understanding how something works can we affect the circumstances around us. 

Which means, identifying the process of depression. 

### Identifying Common Processes

![Identifying Common Processes](/img/blog/08-04.png)

Okay, so now you’re convinced that depression can be understood from the point of view of a process.

Excellent! 

Now give me all your money and sign up to my newsletter. 

YAAAAAAYYYYYYYY.

Anyway, we continue. 

Understanding any process is always gradual, no matter how large or small, is something that comes with experience, self-awareness and time. 

Certainly, no one is expecting you or anyone else to immediately understand how everything in their life works.

We simply need to start small. 

A process can be thought of is a series of events that have a beginning and an end. 

Even more simply, they can be thought of a sequential breakdown of the events that occur in your life. 

Even if you consider yourself a drunken mess of incomprehensible disorganisation, there are everyday processes which we can all identify. 

We eat. We sleep. We think.

All processes we can empathise with. 

Identifying these basic processes is often an excellent place to start and it's important to start small because it allows us to more easily identify larger processes. 

Of course, listing these things (which seem blatantly obvious) is inevitably going to make you feel stupid. 

However it's vital that we do start small and challenge this perception, for a number of dashingly responsible reasons. 

To begin with, our feelings of pointlessness are largely based on our perception of what we know, rather than what we don't.

In the context of this exercise, our feelings are based on the perceived value of time and effort. 

If we hold the belief that effort equates to effectiveness, then naturally anything we approach without this rigorousness will seem pointless.

Instead, I am here to tell you that rigorousness is pointless and ineffective. 

That part of the failure of rumination is this idea that depression can be overcome with effort, when in reality it is overcome with careful co-ordination and control. 

Which in a lot of circumstances, means not thinking at all. 

Furthermore, by doing something simple, we can train our minds to think simply, and break the cycle of rumination many of us face. 

And in the process train ourselves to disregard our expectations of what learning is, and to embace understanding as a process, no different to any other. 

...without collapsing into a pit of anxiety, at the thought of sitting there and doing nothing. 

An example of this is when I started learning undergraduate maths for the first time earlier last year.

In the beginning it was frustrating.  

Despite how much effort I was putting in, I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere. 

I was still stuck on what I percieved to be incredibly basic concepts, and it felt like I was incapable of learning the material. 

What I failed to understand is that the process of learning maths is inherently slow, and that it's normal to spend weeks trying to solve one problem.

It was only once I truly embraced this fact, that I no longer wasted any time worrying about what I should have been achieving, and could instead focus on the task at hand. 

A huge part of understanding any process, is about learning to come to terms with our emotions. 

Because what we're effectively doing is redeveloping our coping mechanisms, by changing the questions we ask ourselves.

Back to our original task, it can help to write down some basic things you do everyday. 

Here’s what I can come up with:

- Wake up. 
- Take bus.
- Work.
- Eat lunch.
- Resume work. 
- Take bus home.
- Eat dinner.

Once you have a basic skeleton, take one of these processes and try to describe what happens. 

For example, with waking up in the morning:

- Hear alarm. 
- Turn off alarm.
- Cuddle girlfriend. 
- Get out of bed. 
- Put clothes on.
- Put charged laptop into bag. 
- Pack lunch.
- Leave house. 

The point of these exercises is to help us become more aware of what goes on in our lives, which will eventually allow us to understand how these processes affect us. 

While these observations are basic, once we become competent in identifying them we can then move onto describing our emotions relative to these tasks. 

So we can become self-aware king, and dictate the way we live our lives. 

### Identifying The Process Of Depression

![Identifying The Process Of Depression](/img/blog/08-05.png)

All it takes is a few minutes each day.

It really is a matter of practice, to build up the skill of identifying basic processes in our lives. 

Though a course of warning: 

It isn't as easy as it looks. 

The reason why it's difficult is because it's an activity we need to consciously engage with, and depression makes this incredibly hard.

Hard because I'm asking you to take control of your thoughts and emotions, to direct it towards something meaningful. 

Hard because you have to refrain from all the negative thoughts in your head, in order to focus and ask the question of "What process am I engaging in right now?" 

In a sense, identifying these processes can be thought of a process of meditation.

In fact, that's literally what this entire article has secretly been about: 

Introducing you to a form of meditation without all the new age crap, so you wouldn't freak out and run away.  

You could be at the cafe. In the shower. In the car. 

Just ask yourself: 

**What process am I currently engaging in?** 

Then once you feel comfortable enough, ask yourself: 

**How does it make me feel?**

Only through engaging this conscious questions can we eventually understand ourselves, in particular, our depression.

Of course, there is one glaring issue that I need to raise. 

While following this method can help you understand your depression and how it arises, it cannot however prevent you from engaging in behaviours that make you feel depressed. 

Such as finding the courage to remove toxic people from your life. 

In most cases however, having any amount of understanding is usually enough to motivate people to change. 

Otherwise, I cannot think of a non-violent, nor ethical way to help. 

In other cases, you may simply lack the domain knowledge to be able to understand the process at hand, in which case professionals can readily close the gap. 

This is particularly true if your depression is caused by diet or nutrition (as is often the case) and you don’t quite understand how eating junk food and getting five hours of sleep a night is bad for your mood.

Again I emphasise this heavily: Knowing that junk food is bad and being able to clearly put into words how junk food affects your mood as a process, are two completely different things. 

So there you have it. 

A certifiable method to help you understand your depression.

It's 31 degrees right now and I'm fucking exhausted. 

<!--

It’s about changing the way we think, not about want we know. People who smoke know it’s bad for them. They simply don’t consciously engage with this understanding enough to truly realise how bad it is. 

Sounds stupid, I know, but the practice of actually consciously thinking about something is much more difficult to do in reality, as opposed to simply read about it. 

Honestly, don’t worry.



CHAPTER 5 EYYY
The reason being that once we become more self-aware and are able to identify basic processes, it can allow us to better grap

allows us to become more conscious of our depression and truly interact with it. 

A common misconception of depression is that simply because we experience depression, we know what actually goes on.

The problem is that even though we have an unconscious recollection of the experience, we don’t have a conscious understand what what took place. 

It’s like the difference between those who read about popular science and those who study the science itself. 

Though the people who read the popular science books have their own understanding of how things work, they often have difficulty explaining what they know with words. 


Much the same can be said of our depression. 

While we can maintain a personal understanding of what our depression is, such as how it feels or what might have triggered it, to actually describe a complete picture of our depression can be a struggle. 

That’s okay and the details of our depression is something we can worry about later. For the time being, we only need to focus on other more basic processes that we are familiar with. 


So now we have an idea of some of these processes which occur in our day-to-day lives. This is a big step, especially if it’s something you’ve never thought out. 

That’s pretty cool. 

Inherently, people don’t actively think in terms of processes. Instead, a lot of what we do is internalised subconsciously in our minds, precisely so we don’t have to think. 

Have you ever traveled to work or maybe even brushed your teeth before bed and immediately after, felt as if you’d been magically transported through time? 

This happens often with tasks we do on a regular basis. We complete them so many times, we no longer need to think of them and we no longer need to consciously think about doing them. 

Our depression functions on a similar basis. We simply engage in behaviours without consciously questioning how they may affect us; behaviours which form into processes which lead to our depression. 

Back to our more familiar processes however, our next step is to continue elaborating so we can continue to grow this new way of thinking. Let’s stick to when we wake up. 

There are a few angles or points of view you can take:

- What time do you wake up? 
- How do you feel when you wake up?
- How long does it take you to wake up?
- What do you see when you wake up? 
- What is the purpose of waking up? 

You may notice something as well when you think about these questions. Your mind slows down. Yes, that is because you are now self-reflecting. 

In fact, what this entire article has described is a process of self-awareness through meditation. 

Tricky, ey? 

Now the idea is to do the same with your depression, to break it down into components so we can understand the wider process and therefore prevent ourselves from future episodes. 

However, that is not what we are going to do. 

Because at the end of the day, dismantling our depression is not an effective strategy. What’s truly important, is changing the way we think to understanding the question of how, rather than why. 

It’s all about how you frame it. 

As you may discover (self-discovery spoiler alert!) depression can be caused by anything, at will, from nearly everything. 

Only by changing the way we think, can we change the way we view the world and subsequently, prevent ourselves from our depression.

Like anything, start small. 










When we eat, you may notice that we need to get the ingredients from the fridge or pantry to be processed.  Which ingredients? How is it processed? Do you eat with a fork or a spoon or with your hands? 

Earlier we asked to identify the basic processes in our lives and that is what we are going to do now. It is important that we consciously identify these processes, because it engages our brain to think about these things. 

To break it down into something more fundamental, there is a difference between actual thinking and learning to think. 

Not to go too in-depth, however thinking is very much an unconscious process, whilst learning to think is a highly conscious process, though this a post for another time. 



That’s stupid. You’re stupid.  

The beauty of intuitive explanations is that they rely on basic definitions. 

No more long-winded multi-paragraph explanations describing this thing called « self-awareness « . Just words. Simple, three-to-potentially-twenty-letter words. Brilliant. 



It’s a simple, though incredibly powerful way of looking at things: 


Certainly, I personally spent years reading self-help articles and websites to no avail. Either the advice sucked or the information was too bloody convoluted to simply stick. 

In other words, these resources were ineffective because they were unintuitive.  

So let's try and undestand why.


Like most people, I get really annoyed when people ask me why I'm depressed. 


Such as why we continually fail to commit to our mental health, however my hands are limited to writing several thousand blocks of text at a time. 

And Funnily enough, the method probably isn't as important as the context, however I digress. 



This article will be split into two parts in order to maintain clarity for the reader. 

The first part explains the idea behind effective explanations, as well as how we misunderstand our depression by asking the wrong questions.

 while the second part focuses on how we can ask the right questions and make progress towards understanding our depression. 


To put this into context, let's try and compare rumination to a movie without a plot.

A movie that you're creating for your own self-discovery.

As we ruminate, we form terrible, uninformed explanations that don't make sense, and that don't bring us any closer to understanding our depression. 

Which isn't too bad in the beginning. 

Sure, there's a few significant loopholes in our film and some random characters appear out of nowhere for no apparent reason, but it's still sort of okay.

It's only once we continue to ruminate and develop these explanations further, that things can visibly begin to fall apart. 

We add more characters, more dialogue, more scenes, not realising that the underlying issue is that none of it works together. 

Our movie becomes bloated and our explanations become weaker.  

We add romance, tragedy, action, comedy, horror, and yet none of it continues to make any sense. 

We become irrational, angry, sad, judgemental and full of hate. We break down and we become a complete mess.
