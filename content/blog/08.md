The aim of this article is to help you come to terms with your depression. 

Ummmm, say what?

Don’t fret, you lucky puck.

I promise it won't involve intense emotional gouging, followed by hours of soul-destroying questioning of your precious most inner-thoughts.

As you can imagine, depression is a heavy topic with a lot of thorny dynamics poking at the edges. 

Which is why this article won't focus on a number of topics that are vital to understanding depression. 

Such as how to commit to recovering, as well as things like understanding how we create motivation, positive agreements, blah blah. 

Those are topics that I will cover in seperate articles, to maintain a firm separation of concerns. 

<!-- Commitment is the only thing that matters.  -->

<!-- Understanding what motivates you (and them).  -->

Instead, what this article will primarily focus on is presenting you with a simple framework which will allow you to better understand your depression.

An effective framework for you to learn and build upon, which will provide you with a very basic and micro point of view of your depression. 

...which in my opinion, is an excellent starting point for those serious about tackling their mental health. 

Of course, please understand that it's a method that does not stand on it's own. 

It requires significant additional context in order to be effective, which I will eventually write about. 

All I can say for now, as I prepare my fingers for the delicious text ahead, is that if you stick with it you'll eventually be able to stop feeling depressed altogether.

Which is pretty cool. Maybe even sexy.

Though baby steps, yeah? 

It’s hard enough when you can barely wake up in the morning, so I'm not asking you to go out and eliminate poverty.

While depression may not an easy topic to grasp, I believe this is more a reflection of the lack of intuitive explanations currently available on the internet.

My job is to trick your brain into believing I'm right, based on how I managed to trick myself into believing that there's merit in being a functional human being.  

So let's begin. 

### Asking The Wrong Questions

![Asking The Wrong Questions](/img/blog/08-01.png)

<!--
So much so, that I'll pretend not to be depressed so that people won't ask. 

You get it. I get it. Well, of course you get it. I know you do.
 -->

Chances are you've partaken in the hilarious dynamic that takes place between yourself and someone else.

A certain someone else who is trying to communicate with you about yuor depression, or at the very least, has the audacity to make comment. 

« So Julius, ummm… y u so sad? » 

...and in the immediate struggle that ensues, you contemplate explaining some horrible fact about your life (which of course, you're currently trying to suppress).

Or explain why they're actually an asshole, because it's none of their business and please, if you could just back off, that would be wonderful. 

Instead, you prompt to mutter an elementary "I don't know" and next thing you know, you've escaped into the nearest closet to avoid any further conversation.

Listen, I clearly have no idea, so please leave me alone. 

Yet despite how much it annoys us when others question our feelings, it's a conversation we continue to pursue within our own head when we're alone. 

You know, as if we're somehow more qualified than the person next to us.

So we sit there, usually alone, and we think. 

We pick apart every single detail in our head, searching for an answer that we feel entirely incapable, nor prepared of answering.

And yet despite how hopeless it makes us feel, we also feel as if we have no choice.

Because we've now made the agreement that we're the only one's who are capable of helping ourselves, and so we pay the price with hopelessness. 

Commonly known as rumination, it's a complete disaster that causes us to collapse further into our jelly-like state. 

It doesn't work, and very, very rarely will, so let's try to understand why. 

A lot of people tend to view rumination as a form of trying, which they equate with effort, which they further equate with solving problems. 

Which makes sense logically in our heads, but fails to deliver because effort doesn't always scale to solving problems. 

I mean, if it were truly that simple, no one would have any problems. 

This isn't to say that we shouldn't question our feelings and thoughts.

It merely identifies the importance of asking the right questions, as opposed to asking wrong questions, which naturally lead to wrong answers, which can only strengthen our depression and mental illness.

Unfortunately, and the reason why rumination doesn't work, is that our depression causes us to ask the wrong questions by design. 

It skews our focus inwards and on ourselves, rather than on the big picture of our depression. 

Which primarily, leads to asking the question of why we feel depressed.

Why we hate ourselves, why our life sucks, as well as why we can't seem to get laid, despite our rigid good looks. 

And that's what we're going to talk about next.

### Constructing A Coherent Narrative

![Constructing A Coherent Narrative](/img/blog/08-01.png)

Part of the problem with asking the question of why is that it provides us with no underlying narrative for us to make sense of. 

In that it skews the narrative we create in our minds, as we try to piece together the thousands of reasons why we feel depressed. 

Narrative is important because it's what allows us to piece together our thoughts and ideas, which further extends to developing hope, motivation and ambition for the future.

Of course, narratives are very tricky things. 

So much so that we largely abuse them, to convince ourselves that we're hopeless, that we're victims, that we're not good enough as human beings. 

As mentioned earlier, this is by design due to our depression.

When we're depressed, we have a tendency to lean towards asking the wrong questions.

Which extends to developing shitty, somewhat retarded narratives that make no sense. 

To put this into context, let's try and imagine a movie without a plot.

A movie that you're creating for your own enjoyment.

As we ruminate we form terrible, uninformed explanations that don't actually make sense, and that don't bring us any closer to understanding our depression. 

In the beginning it isn't too bad. 

Sure, there's a few significant loop holes in our film and some random characters appear out of nowhere, but it's still sort of okay.

So we continue to ruminate and the explanations get worse, to the point where we've deviated from the purpose of our rumination. 

We add more characters, more dialogue, more scenes, not realising that the underlying issue is the overall lack of plot.

Our movie becomes bloated. It's part romance, part tragedy, part action, part comedy, part horror - yet none of it actually makes sense. 

We become irrational. Angry. Sad. Judgemental. We take things personally. We break down and we become a complete mess. 

The funny thing is that part of us knows that our narrative sucks. Yet we're desperate and it's all we have. 

Which prompts us to continue trying to improve this film, rather than admit that it's the wrong approach to the problem. 

On a certain level, we continue trying because it provides us with hope, which is why depression can feel like a never-ending cycle of disrepair. 

Instead, I am going to introduce you to a different way of thinking about your depression, that fundamentally changes the types of questions we ask about ourselves.

We are going to approach constructing our explanations with a plot in mind. 

It's a simple, whole new way of understanding our depression, that doesn't trap us into these meaningless cycles. 

### How

![How](/img/blog/08-02.png)

Here's what we're going to do. 

Instead of asking why we’re depressed, we're instead going to ask how we get depressed. 

Why we get depressed?

No.

How we get depressed?

Yes. 

While it may seem insignificant for now, asking questions from the point of view of how radically changes not only our definition of what depression is, but also how we relate to the emotions and feelings we experience. 

It's truly incredible once you understand why.

Humans are inherently curious creatures, driven to explore, destroy and create in the most dramatic of ways. 

We learn. We aspire. We endlessly question why things are the way they are, in an attempt to uncover hidden secrets.

Yet despite the vast knowledge we have of the world and the universe at large, we still have no idea why things are the way we are. 

We don’t understand why the universe began, why the speed of light travels at a constant, why we can't achieve equality, amongst the millions of other questions our species has pondered. 

Laregly, because none of these questions have actually mattered. 

What truly matters is the question of how, as understanding how something works and functions, allows us to apply them in our lives. 

While we don’t know why gravity is a fundamental force of nature, it hasn’t stopped us from being able to measure and observe it in the design of aeroplanes and other inventions. 

On a more basic level, we know that if we jump from the top of a tree, we're probably going to be in for a bad, bad time. 

In other words, the why isn’t important, because the why doesn't provide us with the insight to understand how something truly works. 

It's the how which provides us with the gold. 

Therefore, it is imperative that we focus on processes, in particular, the process of depression. 

Yes, believe it or not, depression is a process. 

(In fact, everything is a process, and can be broken down into a series of processes.)

Which is a huge game changer. 

A process can be thought of is a series of events that have a beginning and an end. Even more simply, they can be thought of a sequential breakdown of the events that occur in your life. 

Even if you consider yourself a drunken mess of incomprehensible disorganisation, there are everyday processes which we can all identify. You may notice that at some point in the day we may wake up and sleep. 

At some point in the day we eat. When we eat, you may notice that we need to get the ingredients from the fridge or pantry to be processed.  Which ingredients? How is it processed? Do you eat with a fork or a spoon or with your hands? 

These are all questions which can help us better understand the processes (the how of life) which occur in our lives and is an excellent place to start with better understanding our depression. 

When you break depression down to a question of how, it can then be understood from the point of view of series of processes that take place in our minds. 

And you know the best thing about processes? 

Processes are entirely predictable. 

Yep. 

You bet your ass they are, and that's what makes them so damn powerful. 

Remember, understanding why something happens does not provide us with insight to control it. 

Only by understanding how something works can we affect the circumstances around us. 

Which means, identifying the process of depression. 

### Identifying The Process Of Depression

![Identifying The Process Of Depression](/img/blog/08-03.png)

Okay, so now you’re convinced that depression can be understood from the point of view of a process.

Excellent! 

Now give me all your money and sign up to my newsletter. 

YAAAAAAYYYYYYYY

Anyway, we continue. 

To ease ourselves into this new paradigm, we need to ease ourselves into this different way of thinking.

Understanding any process is always gradual, and it's something that comes with experience, self-awareness and time. 

No one is expecting you or anyone else to immediately understand how everything in your life works, 

We simply need to start small. 

It is important to start small because it allows us to identify smaller processes, before we can identity larger ones. 

To engage with this new way of thinking, we need to ask basic questions in regards to the processes in our lives. 

To start, we are going to list the things that we do on a daily basis. 

Now on a certain level this is going to make you feel stupid, perhaps even easy.

Part of the reason being, that it feels almost too obvious and too easy. 

This is a misconception that we have developed which must be addressed. 

To begin with, as seemingly pointless as it may seem, they are entirely fundamental from a learning point of view. 

Our feelings of pointlessness are largely based on our perception of what we know, rather than what we don't, based on how we percieve our time and effort. 

If we have the belief that more is better, that efforts need to be rigorous in order to gain something, then naturally anything we approach that seems less rigorous may seem pointless.

I am here to tell you instead, that the rigorousness you have pursued is in fact pointless. 

That part of the failure of rumination is this idea that depression is overcome with effort, when in reality it is overcome with careful co-ordination and control. 

By doing something simple, we train our minds to think simply. 

And in the process train ourselves to disregard our expectations of what learning is, and to embace understanding as a process, no different to any other process. 

An example of this is when I started learning undergraduate maths for the first time earlier in the year.

In the beginning it was frustrating.  

The first two weeks are a nightmare. I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere. I was still stuck on what I percieved to be incredibly basic concepts

What I failed to understand is that the process of learning maths is incredibly slow compared to other disciplines, and that this isn't a reflection of my own ability to learn maths. 

When I truly embraced that learning maths was an inherently slow process, I didn't worry about my own expectations - because I knew they didn't mean anything. 

A huge part of coming to understand a process is coming to terms with your emotions in relation to the process you're trying to understand. 

What I find usually helps is telling yourself that the process at hand is rational, and that it's me being irrational.

Our first reaction is usually to question what we're doing, rather than to question ourselves. 

Again, what we're effectively doing is redeveloping our coping mechanisms.

So it's not easy, 

Back to our original task, write down some basic tasks you carry out through a typical day. 

Here’s what I can come up with:

- Wake up. 
- Take bus.
- Work.
- Eat lunch.
- Resume work. 
- Take bus home.
- Eat dinner.

Then take one of these processes and describe what happens. For example, with waking up in the morning:

- Hear alarm. 
- Turn off alarm.
- Cuddle girlfriend. 
- Get out of bed. 
- Put clothes on.
- Put charged laptop into bag. 
- Pack lunch.
- Leave house. 

The point of these exercises is to help us become more aware of what goes on in our lives, so we can understand how these processes affect us. 

A common misconception many people have is that because we experience depression, we know what actually goes on.

The problem is that even though we have an unconscious recollection of the experience, we don’t have a conscious understand what what took place. 

It’s like the difference between those who read about popular science and those who study the science itself. 

Though the people who read the popular science books have their own understanding of how things work, they often have difficulty explaining what they know with words. 


### Taking The Usual Approach

![Taking The Usual Approach](/img/blog/08-04.png)


Much the same can be said of our depression. 

While we can maintain a personal understanding of what our depression is, such as how it feels or what might have triggered it, to actually describe a complete picture of our depression can be a struggle. 

That’s okay and the details of our depression is something we can worry about later. For the time being, we only need to focus on other more basic processes that we are familiar with. 

Once we lay the foundation for the easy stuff, it will make it a lot easier to approach the more difficult stuff - like your depression.  

Painting a clearer picture of our depression

So now we have an idea of some of these processes which occur in our day-to-day lives. This is a big step, especially if it’s something you’ve never thought out. 

That’s pretty cool. 

Inherently, people don’t actively think in terms of processes. Instead, a lot of what we do is internalised subconsciously in our minds, precisely so we don’t have to think. 

Have you ever traveled to work or maybe even brushed your teeth before bed and immediately after, felt as if you’d been magically transported through time? 

This happens often with tasks we do on a regular basis. We complete them so many times, we no longer need to think of them and we no longer need to consciously think about doing them. 

Our depression functions on a similar basis. We simply engage in behaviours without consciously questioning how they may affect us; behaviours which form into processes which lead to our depression. 

Back to our more familiar processes however, our next step is to continue elaborating so we can continue to grow this new way of thinking. Let’s stick to when we wake up. 

There are a few angles or points of view you can take:

- What time do you wake up? 
- How do you feel when you wake up?
- How long does it take you to wake up?
- What do you see when you wake up? 
- What is the purpose of waking up? 


You may notice something as well when you think about these questions. Your mind slows down. Yes, that is because you are now self-reflecting. 

In fact, what this entire article has described is a process of self-awareness through meditation. 

Tricky, ey? 

Now the idea is to do the same with your depression, to break it down into components so we can understand the wider process and therefore prevent ourselves from future episodes. 

However, that is not what we are going to do. 

Because at the end of the day, dismantling our depression is not an effective strategy. What’s truly important, is changing the way we think to understanding the question of how, rather than why. 

It’s all about how you frame it. 

As you may discover (self-discovery spoiler alert!) depression can be caused by anything, at will, from nearly everything. 

Only by changing the way we think, can we change the way we view the world and subsequently, prevent ourselves from our depression.

Like anything, start small. 

All you need is a few minutes a day and everything will begin to piece together. You could be at the cafe. In the shower. In the car. 

Just ask yourself: What process am I currently engaging in? How does it make me feel? Where the hell am I?

Only through engaging this conscious questions can we eventually 


### Taking The Usual Approach

![Taking The Usual Approach](/img/blog/08-05.png)


Of course, there is one glaring issue that I need to raise with this method. 

While following this method can help you understand your depression and how it arises, it cannot actually prevent you engaging in behaviours that make you depressed. 

While it can help you understand that certain people in your life are toxic, it can’t give you the courage to actually cut them off.

In most cases however, having that understanding is enough to motivate people to change. 

Otherwise, I cannot think of a non-violent, nor ethical way to help. 

In other cases, you may simply lack the domain knowledge to be able to understand the process at hand, in which case professionals can readily close the gap. 

This is particularly true if your depression is caused by a nutritional issue (as is often the case) and you don’t quite understand how eating junk food and getting five hours of sleep a night is affecting your mood.

Again I emphasise this heavily: Knowing that junk food is bad and being able to clearly put into words how junk food affects your mood as process are two completely different things. 

Conscious. Conscious. Conscious. It’s about changing the way we think, not about want we know. People who smoke know it’s bad for them. They simply don’t consciously engage with this understanding enough to truly realise how bad it is. 

Sounds stupid, I know, but the practice of actually consciously thinking about something is much more difficult to do in reality, as opposed to simply read about it. 

Honestly, don’t worry.

So there you have it: A certifiable method to help you understand your depression. Understandably this article fails to cover , and didn’t go into the specifics of depression itself, however I feel it doesn’t need to.

What is most important is how you think. Once you sort that out, the problems disappear along with it.   

All it takes is a few minutes a day, which will become more and more frequent the more you stick to it. It’s a skill that grows with time. 

Baby steps… I mean, super fundamental awesome steps. 

Oh, and you can let go of my hand now. 


<!--

Earlier we asked to identify the basic processes in our lives and that is what we are going to do now. It is important that we consciously identify these processes, because it engages our brain to think about these things. 

To break it down into something more fundamental, there is a difference between actual thinking and learning to think. 

Not to go too in-depth, however thinking is very much an unconscious process, whilst learning to think is a highly conscious process, though this a post for another time. 



That’s stupid. You’re stupid.  

The beauty of intuitive explanations is that they rely on basic definitions. 

No more long-winded multi-paragraph explanations describing this thing called « self-awareness « . Just words. Simple, three-to-potentially-twenty-letter words. Brilliant. 



It’s a simple, though incredibly powerful way of looking at things: 


Certainly, I personally spent years reading self-help articles and websites to no avail. Either the advice sucked or the information was too bloody convoluted to simply stick. 

In other words, these resources were ineffective because they were unintuitive.  

So let's try and undestand why.


Like most people, I get really annoyed when people ask me why I'm depressed. 


Such as why we continually fail to commit to our mental health, however my hands are limited to writing several thousand blocks of text at a time. 

And Funnily enough, the method probably isn't as important as the context, however I digress. 



This article will be split into two parts in order to maintain clarity for the reader. 

The first part explains the idea behind effective explanations, as well as how we misunderstand our depression by asking the wrong questions.

 while the second part focuses on how we can ask the right questions and make progress towards understanding our depression.
