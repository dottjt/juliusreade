I've spent the past few days writing this article.

And I've come to the conclusion.

That it's impossible to summarise this idea of 'focus' within a sentence. 

I tried, I really did - but it's just not like that.

Certainly, focus is important. 

Arguably, the most important thing a person can have.

So rather than butcher it and create the wrong impression.

I urge you to continue reading so that you can engrain it within yourself. 

And I promise there are a few nuggets of wisdom in this bad boy. 

Hopefully, shedding new light on exactly what focus is. 

As well as why it's a whimsical skill that is so important to master. 

### Why is focus so difficult?

Focus is a tricky subject.

So let's try and tinker with things till they click. 

Focus is literally that - maintaining both our attention and scope of attention on a specific and particular thing. 

Too easy.

The problem is that this definition has very little to do with how we relate to it. 

Something that is in actuality - living, breathing and constantly changing. 

Furthermore, how we go about maintaining our attention is a whole different beast which requires extensive explanation. 

On some level, part of the reason why it's tricky is that it's something that's almost impossible to gauge. 

In other words, humans find it very difficult to tell whether they are focused or not. 

I believe this comes down to the way humans interact with reality. 

Because when you think about it, we usually relate more strongly to our symptoms. 

Rather than the actual consequences of our actions. 

For example, we tend to experience things via our feelings and emotions.

Much more strongly than we do our descriptions of reality. 

When we explain things like break ups. 

Half the time we detail how awful we feel, as well as the range of emotions we exhibit.

As opposed to the nitty gritty of what actually went on. 

I suppose the point I'm getting at is that details tend to be obscured. 

The other reason why focus is tricky is because scope varies. 

The world is so vast and there are so many details, that we become paralysed whenever we have to think about how things work. 

What do we focus on? 


### Why focus is so fundamental

Rather than try to describe focus.

Let's try to understand how we develop it. 

By first addressing the many misconceptions we have about what focus is. 

Many people have this idea that focus is about sheer will.

That it's about drilling down and getting stuff done, regardless of how we feel. 

Sure, that's one way of doing it - but it's not very efficient. 

The problem with sheer will is that it's exhausting and it works against our emotional needs.

### Guidelines Of Focus

Intro: Maybe you don’t have a concept of focus. That’s okay. In terms of learning and playing the long game, learning the concept of focus is a vital for performing your best. Focus forms two seperate parts. The first part is being aware of your attention and the second part is being able to direct your attention. 
Context: Largely, the main reason people don’t have a concept of focus because it simply isn’t a concept that people are aware of. People don’t think about what they’re doing - they usually just do it. The problem with this approach is that it does not allow you to plan. 
Dis: You waste a lot of time on things that are not part of your long term goal.
Change: I started to learn more about focus when studying self-awareness. In the beginning it wasn’t immediately clear how to utilise it .
