Amelia wasn't her real name. 

I never actually found out what her real name was.

Which I still find hilarious, given she even met my mother at one point. 

She said she was interested in renting a room at my parent's place.

In a sense, I think I know why she used a fake alias, however part of what made Amelia so special is that it didn't really matter. 

No one ever truly knew why, and part of you knew that, but then that was why you also wanted to know her. 

To discover the mystery. 

I suppose that was part of her charm - there was something infinitely elusive about her. 

Something magical in the way she acted, as if you were in special company.

As if she were playing some kind of elaborate character.

A hoax?

Assuming she wasn't lying, then she is most likely dead. 

However there is also a chance she could be alive, so it's anyone's guess. 

What made Amelia so interesting is that she would reveal 90% of her life to you, the nitty gritty of her condition.

Yet you would still feel as if you never truly knew her. 

It's like you met all the people in her life, you saw what was going on - yet none of it felt real.

I suppose I'm writing this today to tell you the story of Amelia Snow. 

At least the version of Amelia that I experienced.

I told her I would one day, so here I am in that very day. 

I still don't quite know which aspects of her story are true, nor which were untrue.

So I'm just going to paint the picture as I remember it.

Because the picture is what she wanted you to have. 

Or perhaps I was self-seeking in my desires. 

Hell, I think we all were. 

### The Details. 

![Why Is Compassion So Hard?](/img/blog/13-01.png)

Like most girls, I was hopelessly obsessed with her. 

Amelia was the first girl I ever kissed, as well as the first girl I ever had sex with. 

All within the space of a few hours. 

I first met her on Tumblr. 

At the time I was using Tumblr as a medium to find a girlfriend (this is definitely a story for another time) and we happened to connect.

"Sex and drugs".

Wait, what? 

"Sex and drugs. There's no catch." 

I remember feeling hopelessly giddy at the time, like most guys would have been. 

I'd only been searching for a month (I also had zero experience with women, what-so-ever) so I thought I'd hit jackpot. 

Over the internet she was hopelessly articulate. Intelligent. Breasts the size of watermellons. 

All the things most horny young men desired.

Oh, and the sex and drugs part? I nearly fainted. 

She arranged to meet me at my house, which is where we met at the train station for the very first time. 

She was reading aristotle, which is where she revealed she had high-functioning autism. 

I remember she was flicking through the pages of her book quite rapidly.

She said she could read pages within seconds, and that she had photographic memory. 

She was interested in physics and astrology, and later went on to study these things at University.

At one point she described physically mapping out all the stars in the visible universe onto paper. 

I found it quite amazing. 

There were a few other details I would discover that night. 

She revealed that she was terminally ill, and that she most likely wouldn't live beyond 21. 

She was 19 at the time. 

She also claimed to have had an obsessive rapist. 

In fact, she was originally from Queensland and was staying at her nonna's house (yep, she was Italian), along with her father. 

She was living in the garage downstairs.

### Detached. 

![Detached.](/img/blog/13-02.png)

There was something quite detached about her. 

I suppose in the sense that she wouldn't get attached. 

She didn't like touching or affection (at least not with me).


Well, that was until she met Luke. (I think that was his name, I don't remember)

I remember because shwe were having 


There was also a strong theme of death about her life. 





I remember it being very cold outside, but we got chatting soon enough. 

She was reading aristotle 

She told me that she had 




And obviously, this is where things begin to breakdown. 





Very broken, very smart and very traumatised.



very talented, very, very desired. 



Let's just say, that she had enormous breasts. 

She was desired. 

She was short and pudgy. 


### The Details. 

![Why Is Compassion So Hard?](/img/blog/13-01.png)






I think that was the charm of Amelia - there was something inherently magical about her. 



She would tell stories.
