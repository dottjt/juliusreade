<!--
When In Doubt - Follow The Process
Your process is your mental health strategy
Never Forget Your Process. Ever


-->

I write a lot about processes on this website.

Arguably, because they are superb mental health strategies which allow us to move on from our thoughts and feelings. 

No matter how difficult or confronting they might be. 

A process is something very simple.

It usually comprises of a number of steps which assist us in in taking action.

Calmly, slowly and carefully.

So we don't end up doing something we might regret. 

And in return, encourage desired behaviours/states of mind that allow us to function instead. 

The problem with mental illness is that it's not necessarily something we can comprehend. 

And the more we try to comprehend it, especially in a moment of doubt, the more it twists us and takes control. 

This is where processes come in. 

When all comprehension breaks down, our intuition simply cannot help us.

Which is why the next best thing is to stick to a proven guideline that works. 

That is, the guidelines of those who have successfully dealt with mental illness.

So that when mental illness strikes, you know exactly what you have to do mentally to get out of it. 

### Understanding Our Lack Of Process

The truth is that most of us don't have a process.

Which is scary when you think about it.

To not have a process is to say that we're leaving our mental health to chance.

And chance only. 

It's even more scary to think about the fact that most of us know the outcome will be bad.

And yet we continue to allow mother nature to dictate our strings.  

Certainly, I'm not blaming anyone.

I've been there, and I will likely contniue to go there. 

It sucks. 

But let's talk about some solutions.

I think the main issue is that people simply aren't aware that we can utilise processes in our life to understand our mental health.

We're so pent up and anxious that we don't even realise that we have options to move forward.

In some cases we simply do not have the mental capacity to do so.

However a large part of that is because we haven't developed that mental capacity yet. 

Which is to say that processes are a way of thinking, not something you merely pull off when required. 

What it essentially means is that not thinking is how we've taught ourselves to respond to these situations. 

Sure. 

We may react and have the thought 'Oh, this is not good, I really should do something about this'. 

However that is completely different to taking effective action.

So certainly, there's no reason to be hard on yourself or feel guilty when you do respond irrationally. 

Because that's how you have been taught to think. You literally cannot physically know any better. 

The good news is that humans can learn and change, which means we no longer need to think in terms of being helpless. 

However, in order to adopt this thinking, we first need to be able to put it into words.

So that we can internalise and conceptualise how it actually works.  

Later, I want to write about what makes an effective process, as well as some of the processes I use to move away from my behaviours. 


### What Makes An Effective Process

Certainly, your process is sacred and individual. 



It's like as we're taught as a kid. 

If something bad happens, you call the police.




The problem with mental illness is that it causes us to feel and think irrationally. 

Meaning we do not respond optimally when confronted with something we find interally difficult to comprehend. 



Good processes are like fool-proof recipes. 

They're both simple and effective enough that anyone can just hook in, and walk out unscathed.  

I personally like to think of processes as smarter thinking. 

It's about thinking in a way that simply works. 

As opposed to thinking ineffectively, tripping ourselves up and pursuing the train of regret that comes with alcoholism. 








In life a lot of feelings such as anxiety like anxiety and 

"When in doubt, follow the process"
