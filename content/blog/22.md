**Trigger warning.**

**Although I suppose that's the point, isn't it?** 

It completely destroys me to write this. 

However I still have issues dealing with my first relationship. 

I suppose ...it's one of those things that continues to linger as an unresolved aspect of my personality.

Something that I hope to adddress today. 

--------

Side note: 

Since writing this. 

I've taken some very strong steps towards addressing my mental health.

And while it's been excruciatingly difficult at times.

I know I'm heading in the right direction - and fuck it.

I feel happy. Genuinely happy. 

And it's something I want to write about in my next post. 

Thinking about these things no longer makes me feel sad nor cause an emotional reaction. 

Of course, this article was essentially written two weeks ago.  

So now we resume sad, somewhat confused Julius. 

--------

It's important for me to write this, because I feel like it's the last frontier in my quest for mental health.

That one issue I still haven't quite been able to crack. 

And that continues to affect me on a daily basis. 

The purpose of this post will be to describe my first relationship.

Along with all the issues that continue to tantilise me on a daily basis. 

Largely, because I've gotten a lot worse lately. 

In the past I used to be able to go months at a time without any issues.

However now I've noticed that this is no longer the case, and I know it's because I've been neglecting my mental health recently. 

Everything will be fine... until it's not.

And it'll all come flooding back to me like a bad dream. 

I guess I'm just sick and tired of falling through this predictable cycle, again and again and again. 

I want to be so much better than this. 

Hence why I'm writing this post. 

Now, there are a whole range of emotions that I attach to this relationship. 

Predominantly, guilt. 

I feel as if I'm responsible for all the awful things in her life. 

Which then transpires into shame, along with other useless, negative emotions. 

I feel shame because I cannot accept her for who she is.

Because I know that I could only accept her as a partner, which makes me feel small and unreasonable.

As it completely neglects all the wonderful aspects of her personality.

Blah, blah, blah. 

Largely however, I feel trampled in guilt. 

Which I hope to discuss in detail. 

### The premise

![The premise](/img/blog/22-01.png)

There are a few things you should probably try to understand. 

It was a long distance relationship. 

We met online and it was the first time I'd actually come to genuinely like a girl. 

Perhaps ever, in my entire life.

You see, I was a complete cynic when it came to women and relationships.

Not only because of the constant fighting I'd experienced between my mother and her relationships. 

However also because of mother herself - the worst example of a woman, ever produced. 

Utter garbage. 

I think part of what made it feel so special was the fact that it happened so organically. 

Organic to the point that I didn't even realise we were in a relationship until a few weeks later.

It occurred to me that we were talking every single day. 

And I thought she was the best thing since sliced bread. 

She was intelligent. Gorgeously attractive.

And we would chat everyday over Skype into the late hours of the morning. 

It was love fantasy central. 

So ummmm, where did it go all so wrong? 

Brace yourselves. 

For starters, we both had very severe mental health issues. 

Note: Very Severe.

She had an eating disorder, amongst a range of other issues that I would only find out until later. 

Myself on the other hand... I was self-destructive, completely delusional and severely attached in the worst possible way. 

Hardly a sustainable combination. 

What I find striking is that I remember the exact point at which it all broke down. 

The exact point. 

I remember it so vividly, because it was the moment that sweet girl I adored.

Permanently broke down. 

It was the moment that she disappeared forever. 

I remember she was crying in a complete fit of hysteria, trying to contact me.

One of her 'friends' had claimed to have killed himself.

Of course, it turns out that this wasn't true and that he was only 'joking' - which only made it worse. 

God knows why. 

Yet from that moment onwards, it was as if she transformed into something unrecognisable.

Or rather, it was as if she resumed the narrative of darkness that craddled her on the inside. 

She became a pit of suicidal remonition and depression, to the point of inertia. 

I remember she would just sit there and cry.

And tell me how she wanted to kill herself.

Certainly, it was an aspect of her personality she was trying to hide from me.

Hide from herself. 

<!-- Well, okay.

That's not a fair assessment because I don't know depression is actually who we are on the inside.

But rather, it was the archtype she was most willing to believe in her mind.  -->

And part of me... couldn't accept that.

I mean, she was the love of my life. 

And in my place of heightened euphoria, I couldn't stand to see her like this. 

Hell, I don't think anyone could. 

So in attempting to to do the impossible.

And risk destroying absolutely everything we had in the process. 

I tried to help her. 

### The Delusion

![The Delusion](/img/blog/22-02.png)

I suppose the problem with a word like 'help' is that it's completely subjective in ways that hurt the mind.

Especially within the context of mental illness. 

The issues were numerous.

a) I had literally zero experience with women AND relationships. 

b) I could barely change myself, and so the idea of changing someone else was absurd. 

c) She lived in an entirely different country. 

d) She wasn't ready, nor willing to change.

e) Most importantly, a person's mental illness is completely out of your hands. 

And the list goes on forever. 

Either way, you're completely fucked. 

If you do nothing, then they continue their self-destructive behaviour.

And how the fuck do you not take that personally, when someone is claiming to be on the verge of death? 

Yet if you do something, you only serve to make it worse. 

And they end up hating you and perhaps, end up loathing themselves more. 

<!-- Well actually, there's a third option that I've come to understand. 

Acceptance of the situation - which essentially means leaving the relationship. 

Of course, I was waaaayyy too naive and head-over-heels at the time to have considered it.  -->

Certainly, I can't help but feel that my attempts at helping her merely turned her off wanting to help herself. 

Regardless, to compensate (at least within my own mind) I decided to become more attached. 

I thought that if I displayed more affection that maybe it'll make her feel better about herself?

You know, because it'll make her feel loved?

<!-- Just as I felt about her?   -->

Naturally, it ended up having the exact opposite effect. 

Instead, it made her feel even more exhausted than she already was. 

I remember she would always say that everything was utterly exhausting for her.  

As if everything in her life were a chore, myself included. 

(obviously, I took that personally in the worst possible way)

Between her eating disorder, irregular sleeping patterns and excessive self-judgement.

It's hard to blame her. 

Which is why I ended up blaming myself. 

In retrospect, I've also come to understand that my affection served as a coping mechanism. 

Basically, I couldn't deal with the fact that my sweetheart had disappeared.

And so I ended up creating this fantasy image of her. 

To repress who she really was. 

And to continue that ditzy 'love story' I'd created in my mind.

I remember I would just sit there and think about her in this sort of daze of euphoria.

As if she were this kind of goddess. 

And in my affection, I would create these wild stories in my mind about how amazing she was.

In the process, becoming this kind of emotional zombie.

Obsessed with something that wasn't real, nor there. 

Certainly, I created the impression in my mind that we would be together forever.

Which I suppose, helped deal with hearing that she was suicidal on a daily basis. 

In particular, she would comment on being triggered each time she'd walk past the train tracks. 

Now of course, I don't deny that this must have been awful for her. 

And I wish her well. 

However imagine me, this guy who's never experienced love, nor ever been in a relationship in his entire life. 

Finally discover the woman of his 'dreams'.

Who is now being told on a daily basis that the person they love most wants to kill themselves. 

Unable to do anything because their girlfriend lives in a completely different country.

Let alone hold them or reassure them that everything will be okay. 

That's why I feel guilt.

That's why I feel helpless at times.

<!-- It was conflicting, because on the one hand I didn't want to lose her. 

On the other hand, I knew I would lose her if she remained suicidal.  -->

So I did what anyone would. 

I put everything on the line. 

I did everything in my power to try to help her.

And yet in the end, the only way I could help her was by deluding myself into thinking that everything was okay. 

It was a mess. 

### The visit

![The visit](/img/blog/22-03.png)

Prior to the breakdown, we decided to meet in person.

I remember anxiously counting down the days over the coming weeks.

Awaiting her arrival. 

I think the thing that excited me the most was that we were going to have sex.

I'd only had sex once in my life, and now I was going to have a whole weekend of sex.

Lucky me. 

Ultimately, she came over for a total of three days. 

And it was the last I ever saw of her.

I remember the night she arrived.

It was pouring down rain, and I'd gone on my bike to see my friend in Box Hill.

Some 15 minutes away.

And I remember checking the time, realising that I wouldn't get home before her taxi arrived. 

So I rode my bike as fast as I could and I remember speeding into my driveway.

To see her standing at my front door, speaking with my housemate who could barely speak English.

She must have been terrified. 

I quickly got her in and into my room. 

And I sat at my desk.

I was both terrified and completely out of breath from rushing home. 

Completely clueless as to how I should approach her. 

So she kindly asked me to sit next to her on the bed, and we started to kiss.

Now it begs to note that our relationship was incredibly short-lived relatiosnhip. 

It only lasted 2 - 3 months at most. 

And I think that's part of what made it so difficult for me. 

I never truly felt like I got to know her. 

In fact, when I come to think about it, there's very little that I actually know about her. 

Largely because of this intense fantasy image I created of her.

And because in reality, her depression formed a large part of her life.

Which you realise, ends up being quite repetitive and plain. 

Over the past few years I've tried reconnecting with her, pretending as if everything were still okay.

And everytime I'd ask her anything she'd provide me with the exact same answer:

"I don't know."

Like literally, that would be her answer to everything.

Probably because she was so exhausted all the time, and simply couldn't comprehend anything. 

And of course, in my hyper 'take-everything-personally' state.

It's like, how do I even interpret this?

Is she lying?

Does she actually not know? 

Is she even in any mental state to be asking these questions?

A futile quest in trying to understand something which will never reveal itself.

I suppose one aspect that makes me feel sad.

Is this idea that it's almost as if I never existed in her world. 

As if she didn't even have the energy to comprehend who I was. 

Of course, there's so much that goes unsaid within this post.

Like when I blamed her for not being able to orgasm.

The fact that she cheated on me with her ex, and even tried to become his fiancee weeks post-breakup. 

Or like when I got my friend who was a psychology student to talk to her over Skype in order to help her.

Man, talk about awkward. 

But in attempting not to write a novel.

I'll leave it here. 

### The Reveal

![The Reveal](/img/blog/22-04.png)

Eventually I decided it was best to break up. 

I could no longer deal with her depression. 

Of course, in my humpty-dumpty fantasy land I didn't actually realise we were breaking up. 

In my mind, I was under the impression that we were merely taking time apart. 

So we could regroup later, once we'd both sorted out our mental health issues.

At least that's what I tried to communicated to her. 

Naturally, I was too naive to understand otherwise. 

Certainly, she'd become so emotionally dead that I don't even think she recognised that we were even in a relationship at that point. 

Then, it was only once we broke up that she explained the rest of her story.

(well actually, I remember being very passive-aggressive when she eventually gave in)

She was raped as a child.

She was a dysfunctional alcoholic as a teenager.

She'd experienced all sorts of odd relationships with all sorts of different men. 

And in my mind, I couldn't help but think - why didn't you just tell me this stuff earlier?

Why? Why? Why?

Of course, I think part of the reason was due to my naivety and lack of maturity.

In particular, the delusion I'd fallen into.

That I think she'd recognised.

And it was from this moment that I developed this intense insecurity within me.

Like, fucking intense. 

I became highly insecure around this idea that she was hiding something from me. 

And it became this kind of wild obsession of mine. 

Which would continue to linger for years. 

Of course, this wasn't the first time she'd kept something from me.

I remember when we were together, she'd made a post on her blog about doing something for a 'client'. 

And I became intently curious, and so I asked her what she meant by that.

Immediately, she changed the wording on her post. 

And I couldn't help but wonder if my girlfriend was a sex worker of sorts.


<!-- 
Which lead to this intense obsession which ravished me on the inside.

  -->

However, from that moment of discovering these things about her. 

I would begin to obsess about her daily.

Not in a pleasant way. 

But I would just sit there in agitation, fighting my own imagination. 

I couldn't get her out of my head, and the more I thought about her, the worse I became. 

Although I suppose that's just basic neurology and self-reinforcement. 

Eventually my curiosity turned into this intense anxiety.

That would rip me apart and ravish me. 

I just couldn't deal.

I honestly couldn't. 

And to make things worse, she told me I was the only person she could speak to anymore.

As everyone else had cut her out of their life. 

And yet because I was so heart-broken and irrational, I decided to shut her down.

<!-- And I became incredibly passive-aggressive in trying to deal with my emotions. -->

And cut her out of my life. 

I felt conflicted because I still loved her, yet I didn't quite know who I loved.

Was it my image or her, or the actual person I was speaking to?

I felt angered and torn, unable to deal with it all. 

And for the first time in my life, I remember experiencing my first suicidal thought.

I was at work, unloading a pallet of goods. 

(ol' shelf-stacker I was)

And I remember picking up a bottle of garden poison. 

And thinking... 

It honestly wouldn't make a difference if I just swallowed the whole thing right now. 

A few moments later I had an intense emotional break down.

And I decided to go home early. 

### The Problem

![The Problem](/img/blog/22-05.png)

My mental health problems are numerous, as I'm sure you've come to understand. 

However I feel like they can be summarised down into two main points. 

Firstly, I still view her as the perfect girl in my mind. 

This perfect person I will never talk to again, nor make acquaintance with. 

Which is jarring, because I know it's nothing more than this elaborate image within my mind. 

So perhaps it might help to understand the narrative that takes place within my mind. 

It says: 

"She is the perfect girl."

"Well, she would be perfect if it weren't for her mental health issues."

"And you Julius Reade, are the reason why she has those mental health issues."

"Because you failed to help her, and you made her life worse."

Precisely, I feel guilt for leaving her, and not seeing her through with her mental health issues. 

(the glaring assumption I make in my mind, is that it's even possible to see someone through with their mental health issues)

I feel guilt for all the ways in which I did try to help her. 

I feel gult for all the genuinely awful things I contributed towards the relationship. 

I feel guilt for my incompetence. 

I feel guilt for not being able to accept her for having mental health issues.

And it's this part I feel the most guilt for. 

Because that just what happens when you become irrationally attached.

Which then makes me feel guilty for even existing. 

And my mind will endlessly loops through these points like a faulty circuit.

Paralyzing me entirely.

So what is the cure to all this madness?

For starters, dissolving this idea that she's some kind of perfect god.

Which is incredibly hard to do, given how attractive and intelligent she actually is in real life.

...or at the very least, have portrayed her to be in this grand image I hold in my mind.  

Self-acceptance is also a huge thing.

I have to accept the circumstances for what they are.

I have to accept myself for who I am, and understand that I am not a reflection of her. 

I have to accept that all these ideas I have merely exist within my imagination. 

I have to accept the fact that I am not responsible for her mental health. 

As well as accept the fact that I have the power to change and become a better person.

After all, I have my own issues to worry about. 

I suppose the difficult thing about experiencing guilt is that you completely discount the responsibility other people.

Precisely, that she is responsible for her mental health.

And that only she has business in that. 

<!-- Which makes me feel uneasy because it's like, how am I suppose to know where that line exists?  -->

<!-- Are you never supposed to help anyone.  -->



### The Positive

![The Positive](/img/blog/22-06.png)

If it's one thing I can't deny, it's that breaking up with her was important.

It was important because it signified the first time in my life that I'd decided to take my mental health seriously.

Again, I didn't quite realise it at the time.

But the fact that I even had the courage to call it off, I think, was a huge thing for me. 

<!-- And even though I end up doing a lot of stupid things. -->

<!-- I suppose I've always considered myself a fighter. 

As a reflection of this idea that there's a very strong part of me that refuses to go full-retard.  -->

<!-- And I'm glad that I've been able to break out of my haze. -->

That moment of change was also quite violent. 

I'd had an incredibly 'bad' trip on a particular recreational research chemical.

(unintentionally, mind you - well, I guess it depends on how you view the self-destruction)

And I literally went insane. 

I ended up breaking my arm by repeatedly punching in a solid glass door. 

I nearly punched a woman in the face. 

The whole street was out to witness me scream in percieved agony.

As the rain poured and a pair of policemen pulled their guns on me. 

I was taken to hospital, where I abused staff. 

It was brutal.

(very long story, I'll write about it some time)

Thankfully my mother was away overseas, so I didn't have to deal with her. 

But the point is, I was a complete wreck. 

Following my release from hospital, I decided to buy as much junk food as possible.

Just the absolute worst processed shit you can think of, so I could binge my sorrows away. 

In particular, I remember buying this massive pack of Woolworths cheesy schnitzels.

That just looked so damn good. 

And I remember lying in bed, struggling to eat the fucking thing (my right arm was in a cast). 

Ready to dry-wretch at how fucking god-awful these schnitzels were. 

When it suddenly hit me. 

I realised that I no longer wanted to live my life like this anymore. 

And that I was going to take my mental health seriously for once. 

From that point onwards, I felt willing to do absolutely everything within my power to ensure that my mental health was sorted. 

I'd hit rock-bottom and I was going to do something about it. 

Based on a quick Google search I discovered this website called Pathway To Happiness.

And it was quite incredible.

Unforunately I never ended up completing the course. 

Personally speaking, I think I was too young to understand it all.

Regardless, I'd also read a number of books that helped me better understand my depression.

In particular, this book about learned helplessness.

Which described depression as a symptom based of optimism/pessimism.

In my enlightenment I remember trying to explain these ideas to my ex, and she immediately shut them down. 

Of course, it wasn't until I reached the end of the book that it advised not to introduce these ideas to someone who already had severe depression.

As it'll merely make them more pessimistic.

HA. 

Of course.

### The Resolution

![The Resolution](/img/blog/22-07.png)

I'm really glad I wrote this, because it's helped clarify a lot of things within my mind. 

In particular, what I need to do moving forward. 

As I tend to write these articles over two week periods. 

I began retaking the Pathway To Happiness audio course as soon as I started writing this.

And it's been tremendously wonderful.

It's really helped change the way I think and feel about life. 

I suppose you could say that my obsession with her became my go-to destructive responsive whenever I was feeling down. 

Much like my addiction with pornography. 

It was something I'd do ...simply because it was an instinctual response to feeling worthless about myself.

Rather than because it had any real meaning. 

I think the reason why my mental health has suffered lately is because I've stopped bothering to be self-aware.

Which in essence means giving up self-control. 

I also find it's helpful for me to think about how far I've come.

Sure, I've regressed lately - however that isn't to say that I haven't been heading down the right track for quite some time now. 

I've been eating healthily, I've been keeping myself preoccupied with my ambitions, I exercise frequently, I even take cold showers for good measure.

Another really important thing for me (at least a while ago) was to prove that I could be in a functioning relationship.

Which I think has helped me realise that I'm not a broken person, nor bad person. 

Of course, I've also come to realise that it's not about proving anything.

Instead it's about learning to let go and I feel like that's why I wrote this post.

So I can finally let go and look at life from a different point of view. 

Certainly, I'm feeling determined.

And much like my weight lifting, I want to treat it as something that I do regularly. 

My little nest egg I grow each day.  

<!-- 


I want to be able to read this post in the future and be proud of how much I've changed. 

To continue my path towards becoming a better person. 

And let go of these feelings that merely hold me down. 

Instead, I want to be happy. 


it's a cycle I now want to break. 

I feel like it's something that's gotten worse lately. 

And I know it's because I've been neglecting my mental health, thinking that it's merely going to sort itself out. 

One thing I really want to do is get back on the Pathway To Happiness audio course. 

That website introduced me to so many incredible concepts. 

Such as understanding gratitude and remaining neutral with your thoughts.

I want to begin reintroducing meditation back into my life.


For the past few years or so, my thoughts of her had reached a point of becoming managable. 

I wouldn't think about her for months at a time, only returning to that dark place whenever I'd have a breakdown. 


I don't know why, it's just what my brain does whenever I collapse into a pit of helplessness. 

While it wasn't too bad, 


Now, I suppose what I want to do is go into detail as to how I messed up.

Before then, some context.

As it turns out, 



So many things that went wrong, that it's hard to say where to even begin.

For starters, I blamed her for not being able to orgasm when we met up.

Which is clearly the worst possible thing you can do to a person. 




A significant issue was the fact that 

She would always say everything was exhausting for her.  

For starters, it almost wasn't a real, functional relationship. 

Rather, I would describe it as a dopamine hit of disillusion. 




Part of me feels like she didn't even care.

I remember weeks after our relationship ending she told me that she'd was in talks with her ex's parents about marriage.

And I was like, what the actual fuck. 

The very man who you claimed took advantage of you sexually weeks into our relationship. 


I often compare to our break to when someone realises that their religion was an outright lie. 








Maybe it'll help you to understand that I had incredibly limited experience with women up until this point. 







Well, I've gotten better. 

I can usually go weeks at a time without any issues.



I would say doing those two things have helped me most. 

You know, spending more time actually doing something, and to define who I am, rather than linger on the past.

And some days it's impossible.

You literally want nothing more than to breakdown and curl into a ball of nothingness.

Into that destructive world of lust and obsession. 

And I admit that sometimes I do. 

As for her? 

I suppose I wish her well. 

If it's one thing I've discovered in my life, it's that the only way I've ever learnt is by making a complete mess of something. 

And certainly, this relationship was a wake up call in a lot of different ways. 

I don't think it's worth blaming anyone. 

Blame simply leads to more guilt, and that's something my life needs less of. 

It kills me to say this, but please don't contact me. 

All I want to do is contact you, but I know it's just my brain wanting something that doesn't exist. 

Regardless, I wish you best of luck. 




Of course, I also feel as if I'm a source of trauma for her, which extends the guilt and shame out further.

Which makes me feel helpless. 

And I could honestly write an entire book with this kind of back-and-forth narrative which simply goes nowhere. 

So instead, we're going to stop and recollect.
