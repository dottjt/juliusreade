I have two simple philosophies that help guide me through life. 

"...the inconsequential bread and butter of our human experience."

Hopefully you can find them useful.
<!--Perhaps they can be of use to you. -->

I suppose I would call them 'recession philosophies'.

Philosophies designed to carry you through hardship, and assist you in overcoming the surreal harshness of reality. 

Because the problem is that the system can no longer support itself. 

Which means many people are losing out, in particular, younger generations like myself. 

In the year 2017 it's literally impossible to find work, let alone be able to afford the opportunities of past generations - such as home ownership. 

And it's only getting worse by the day. 

You can be fully-qualified, over-qualified, or the best damn technical or cultural fit possible.

It literally doesn't matter - the work simply isn't there. 

I made it to a final-stage interview at an amazing company, only to have the position turned down because they were worried they'd have to fire me again in three months. 

It's hard, but this kind of lackery requires you to maintain hope under extreme pressure.

In other words, to learn to suffer gracefully. 

And that's how having a few fine-tuned philosophies in life can really help. 

Because when you embrace the suffering, you become impenetrable. 

Personally speaking, I don't take too much notice of these philosophies anymore. 

Initially I would consciously think about them in times of desperation.

However now my brain has been wired to just get shit done. 

Ultimately, because I understand that I lessen my human experience by not following these guidelines, as well as reduce what I'm ultimately capable of. 

In essence, these two philosophies are predominantly designed to help promote achievement, without the resounding guilt or judgement. 

Note: Without the resounding guilt or judgement. 

Because while a lot of us know how to be successful. 

Very few of us know how to do it without also developing an addiction or dragging our ego along for the ride.

Don't be that person. 

### Philosophy One. 

![Life is hard, so you may as well make it harder.](/img/blog/17-01.png)

My first philosophy is about resilience:

**Life is hard, so you may as well make it harder.**

It relies on this premise that life is inherently hard, and that it's never going to get easier. 

Which is to say that life will always be sufferable, regardless of which path you take.

The aim of this philosophy is to highlight this idea that there's no fear or harm in pushing yourself to your limits. 

Because when life is already hard, making it more 'difficult' for the time being will have literally zero impact on your life. 

So bloody hell, don't be a dickhead and pursue all the meaningfully difficult paths in life, because at least you'll grow from it. 

#YOLO

'cause let's face it, folks. 

A lot of life is pretty fucking awful.

Most of the time we just don't realise it because we're so exhausted, stressed and under pressure, that we don't even have time to process the suffering. 

Let me tell you.

Waking up at 5:45am each morning because the rent is too damn high to live any closer to work, just ain't normal.

And even though I'm used to it, part of me wishes I didn't have to.  

So honestly, what difference is it going to make lifting unbearably heavy weights to point of bodily cramps, or bunkering down for a few hours to learn something useful that may even bore you to death? 

Precisely.

There really isn't any. 

And that's what motivates you to choose the inherently more difficult path. 

Because when you're already bathed in pain, painful choices become easy to make. 

So where do most people go wrong?

**They fail themselves in assuming that some forms of suffering are worse than others.**

They ultimately cannot understand that working out or trying to better themselves isn't the only thing that sucks in life. 

Everything else sucks too. 

The cake you're currently eating sucks, because it's making you unhealthy. 

Sitting and watching TV sucks, because it's making you dumb.

It all sucks, and yet people have preference as to what sucks more. 

I suppose part of this comes down to awareness. 

With this understanding that life will never get easier, you become aware of the fact there's consequences not only in your actions, however also in your existence.

And that you're always going to pay, one way or another.

If you choose the 'easy' option, you essentially lose out in gaining any insight into the human experience - which is a form of suffering.

Yet if you choose the 'hard' option, you still have to suffer to claim your reward. 

The suffering in both cases is exactly the same, because the consequences are equal. 

And when everything in reality sucks equally, your experience becomes dictated by time.

Rather than effort.

Which is to say that as long a you commit your time to suffering meaningfully, you'll be fine.  

The key point here is that by normalising your suffering, you normalise the choices in your life. 

And it allows you to begin viewing life in terms of possibility.

Rather than with doubt or fear. 

Instead of viewing something as a challenge, it merely becomes another task dictated by choice and time.

Pretty cool, ey? 

On a more fundamental level, this philosophy is about choice and embracing the cause and effect of life. 

Certainly, it helps me tremendously when I don't feel like working out, or I'm feeling a bit lazy in the haze of depression.

It helps rationalise the challenge, pressure, ambition and stress I put myself under each day, without throwing the baby out with the bath water.

### Philosophy Two. 

![Everyone experiences and goes through the same thing.](/img/blog/17-02.png)

My second philosophy is quite similar in what it aims to achieve, although it approaches the issue from a different angle.

(Come to think about it, I feel like these philosophies are quite nhilistic, though I'm certainly no philosophy literature whiz-bang.)

**Everyone experiences and goes through the same thing.**

This one is beautiful. 

I suppose it's a counter-balance to the first philosophy.

What it's essentially saying is that everyone suffers and experiences the same kind of suffering.

In other words, that there is absolutely nothing special or unique about you, what-so-ever.

In that everyone experiences happiness, sadness, guilt, shame and everything else inbetween. 

To the same relative degree. 

We all feel that same relative level of anxiety when we approach an interview, or ask a stranger out to a date. 

We all feel that initial lack of dread when the thought of having to workout pops in our head. 

We all want to binge on dopamine and escape from reality. 

Everyone is fucked. 

We're all inherently the same, and we all experience the same bullshit in trying to achieve greatness.

The only thing that's truly different is in how we choose to react, and that's what this philosophy is trying to highlight. 

This philosophy is tremendously helpful, because it aims to dissolve what you think and feel about yourself.

And help you realise that your emotions, your feelings and your understanding of the world isn't inherently special.

And therefore, aren't a real threat or influence on how you decide to live your life.

In essence, what it's really saying is that you shouldn't take your feelings, thoughts or emotions personally, because dey r knot reel. 

Therefore, allowing you to push through those difficult feelings as something external, not internal to who you are. 

Essentially, everyone is normal. 

Which a lot of people take to mean average, however that's only assuming that you think you're special (assuming you take an optimistic approach towards this quandry).

**Instead, it highlights this wonderful idea that to be normal, is to have the opportunity to grow and become great.**

It embraces this notion that everyone is normal and that from there, they decided to become something more. 

The same, normal, fucked-up, retarded, fundamentally flawed human being, all trying and failing at the same time. 

Ultimately, it denotes the imporance of hard work, as well as embracing your own responsibility to dictate our success in life. 

It is what allows us to truly understand that life is an level-playing field, relative to our position.

And the only thing stopping you, is your lack of willingness to suffer. 

### Le Close. 

![Everyone experiences and goes through the same thing.](/img/blog/17-03.png)

So there you have it. 

In summary, life is hard and everyone experiences that same hardness. 

It acknowledges that every one of us faces the same challenges each day, and that we have choice in how we choose to deal with those challenges. 

Bon appetite.
