Fool proof way to overcome addiction.

I have very little sympathy for myself. 

I don't believe I necessarily deserve forgiveness, nor 

Recently I happened to stumble upon this thing called compassion. 

And it's really changed the way I think and feel about things.

I mean, I know of compassion, much like I know of charity or tolerance. 

But when you don't consciously thinking about these things, they merely become words in your vocablary rather than actual concepts you relate to. 

Certainly, I'd become so detached from reality, that when I read about these concept of compassion for the first time in years, it managed to blow a few circuits in my mind. 

It sort of reminded me of when I discovered the term 'estrangement' for the first time, and it's interesting how the mere mention of certain words or concepts can violently shatter our interpretation of reality. 

Admittedly, I'm not a very compassionate person.

I'm not sure if I ever used to be, however it's something that I can tell has gotten worse over the years. 

In pursuing my goals, I taught myself to detach from the people around me.

I mean, it wasn't perfect, but I viewed it as a necessary evil more than anything. 

In my mind I felt it was the only way to get anything done, which made complete sense at the time. 

Put simply, I was surrounded by shitheads. 

People who did nothing to contribute towards my mental health. 

And this was my way of dealing with that. 

I suppose the problem is that even though those circumstances have changed and I've managed to leave all these people behind.

My attitude towards life is still stuck in hostility. 

I still rely on this hatred to protect myself, and that is something I want to change.

Given my awareness of the situation. 

Okay, the intro isn't too great, but I promise there's a lot to learn from this one. 

### Why Is Compassion So Hard? 

![Why Is Compassion So Hard?](/img/blog/13-01.png)

According to Google compassion is the "sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others".

In other words, empathy for those in lesser positions.

(I'll get to the mind-blowing realisation in the next chapter).

The funny thing about compassion is that it isn't difficult. 

There's nothing about compassion that doesn't make sense. 

It's literally something that just clicks in your mind. 

Yet what makes compassion so difficult is that it's an entirely foregin concept in modern society. 

We are not taught to be compassionate, and most companies view compassion as a form of weakness.

Instead, we are taught about responsibility and blame. 

Competition doesn't breed compassion. 

It's do or die - and that is something you drill into yourself. 






Yet for whatever reason,  compassion is difficult.


What makes it difficult is the society 



I suppose what makes it hard is that it's just a foreign concept in modern society.

We don't live in a compassionate society. 

In my head I'm stuck in this world of diminishing promises and brutal competition, and believe part of my humanity died along with it. 

Certainly, even though I knew something wasn't right with me, I merely thought it was a necessary burden in my pursuit for productivity. 

Part of the consequence of this attitude is that I developed resentment towards others, rather than undesrtanding.

I merely focused on my own point of view and how I was benefiting, which although valid - provided nothing for my mental health. 




### Self-Compassion. Holy Shit.

 - the reasons of which I want to explore within this article. 

Yet now that this idea of compassion has come to my attention, 

What is compassion?

If I had to describe compassion, I would say that it's hope without the resentment.



### Breaking The Us Vs Them Mentality.  

![Why Is Compassion So Hard?](/img/blog/13-02.png)

People make awful logicians.

One of the biggest logical fallacies we make, and one that has very significant consequences, is this idea that arguments are one dimensional. 

For example, we believe either that someone either hates us or likes us. 

Yet we don't think in the possibility that maybe it's because we hate or like ourselves.
