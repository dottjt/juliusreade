<!-- 
Mental Illness Has Always Been A Problem Of Emotion
Your emotions are an elaborate lie. 

-->

1

Mental illness has always been a problem of emotion.

We either feel too much, too little or not at all, and it's what causes to act 'irrationally' depending on the flavour of the month.

(Though apparently if you use it to make money, then it's actually encouraged and becomes a totally valid thing)

Unfortunately for most of us, acting irrationally is not a choice.

We have bills to pay. Ambitions to catch. 

Hell, I would love to be mentally ill and constantly drug-fucked all the time, but the reality is that it stops being fun after a certain level of poverty.

You find yourself becoming sad and depressed for very legitimate reasons, such as being unemployed. 

Not to mention for many of us, stability is the only way we'll ever seek success in life.

Yes, that awful s-word so many of us fear. 

I suppose the crux of it all is that if you're ever going to understand your mental illness, you'll probably need to figure out how your emotions work. 

Which I'm sure many people find terrifying. 

After all, part of the elusiveness of mental illness is in choosing not to understand yourself, as there's a kind of glamour to the ditzyness of being in shame.

And I would totally agree.

But I'm not here to agree. 

I'm here to connect you with reality. 

Because ultimately behind the veil we profess, our emotions aren't really that complex at all.

We're just idiots.

There's one analogy about our emotions that I absolutely adore, which I will share with you today.

Ultimately, emotions can be thought of as traffic lights. 

Traffic lights, for those unaccquianted, are the lights you see at intersections. They indicate to cars whether they should stop or keep going.

When you think about it, no one really thinks much of traffic lights. 

They're there. They work. Hell, you definitely expect them to work. That's all there really is to it. 

Yet what happens when the power goes out and they stop working, or if they don't work as intended? 

Well, most people keep driving. 

They're certainly more cautious and they're communicating with other drivers and giving way, however little has changed for them.

The fact is, they're prepared.

They understand the road rules, they have the confidence within themselves to continue and they ultimately end up getting from point a to b. 

They have the confidence within themselves to continue, in lieu of the chaos and challenges ahead. 

Others on the other hand freak out. 

Some I'm sure, in absence of assistance, would stay permanently at the traffic lights and not move. Some would refuse to even leave the house at all. 

They don't feel comfortable driving, because they don't feel prepared. 

These people are us.

Of course, instead of traffic lights, we have emotions.

Our emotions tell us to move forward, or to stop, along with the hundreds of other signs available on the road.

They tell us when it's safe, when we should be afraid, when we should feel guilt, amongst a whole range of things. 

The only problem is that our emotions have stopped working. 

They are no longer indicating correctly.

Ultimately, emotions are specialised indicators. 

Much like traffic lights, they're designed to guide you towards making the "right" decision. 

"Feeling sad? I know, I'll think something positive!"

The problem is that a lot of us didn't learn how to make that right decision.

Instead, the narrative went a little more like: "Feeling sad? Well maybe if I starve myself and get really skinny, I'll like, feel better about myself?".

Through our own interpretation we began reinterpreting the meaning of those green and red lights, beyond which they were originally intended. 

This is the human curse. The ability to make something okay, and turn it into other shit. 

I suppose the big difference between driving a car and the conscious human mind, is that the immediate urgency or danger of bastardising our emotions does't become apparent until much later. 

We don't necessarily risk death when we ignore our emotions or proceed with a negative mindset.

Often, the feedback is small if not neglible - unlike winding your body around a tree at 100km/ph due to vague drowziness. 

The issue is that these problems or reinterpretations arise over time, as we slowly reinforce these behaviours into our mind. 

It's never the first time you told yourself you're worthless. It's the 20,000th time that finally puts the nail in the coffin. 

Ultimately, it's the idea that through small agreements, we create large. 


It's self-reinforcing . Soon it becomes just your emotions.

The other consequence of this slow trickle, is it makes us oblivious to how we got there in the first place.

So much so that people don't become aware of the fact that they have issues, because they assumed the programming was working as intended. 

Which is how people end up with a BMI of 800 or develop an incredibly judgemental attitude - these outcomes are reinforced over decades, one thought at a time.

Of course, I can't imagine thinking ourselves out of this situation is going to be of much help. 

Which is why we need a few hacks to help us get there.

The beautiful thing about our emotions is that they're merely indicators.

Which is to say that they're nothing more than empty vessels until we provide them with context and meaning. 

Because the truth is, meaning and value are created through our own beliefs and interpretations of reality.

In the overall scheme of things, this provides us with two options moving forward:

We can either detach our emotions from our beliefs and expose them for what they are - indicators.

Alternatively, we can change our interpretations so that they no longer provide our emotions with meaning. 

The first one provides us with immediate results, while the second method provides us with long-term results. 

Personally speaking however, I find we can go a long way by tackling our emotions and detaching ourselves from them. 

What this ultimately means is that we don't need to listen to our emotions. 

Often the best way to do this is to observe our emotional state, and pretend as if you're not yourself and that you're merely observing yourself.

It can help to imagine yourself stepping away from your body, as if you're watching yourself from a 3rd person point of view.

On the otherhand, trying to talk to yourself out of your emotions, at least I find, doesn't help. 

Because you end up engaging with yourself from a 1st person point of view, which merely solidifies what you're feeling. 

Thinking your way out of your emotions also usually doesn't help.

The problem is that the act of thinking engages with your beliefs which merely reinforces and makes you more attached to your emotions.

Observation on the other hand is designed to detach yourself. 

Another aspect to consider is how we can best gauge reality.

If not for our emotions, then what? 

When traffic lights go down, we still have other references to navigate through reality, such as our vision. 

Which is no different to when our emotions go haywire. 


This is similar with when we lose sense of our emotions.

I suppose this explains the idea behind not taking things personally.

To take something personally, is ultimately to provide your emotions with power and to legitimise them. 

Which really is to treat the broken traffic light before us as a source of truth. 

Also known quite suitably as delusion.

I know it's gonna sound lame, di

I don't think there's an easy way to overcome delusion, however

And it's no wonder, because emotion is a very powerful thing. 

It's the number one tool we use to gain trust and respect, as well as to convey our intentions. 

Though I'm sure you already know this.
