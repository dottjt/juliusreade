A couple of weeks ago I was hanging out with a friend in the city.

I usually enjoy these catch-ups because it usually devolves down into a prolonged pseudo-therapy session of anxiety and self-angst, where we usually exchange trumatic episodes from our lives.

In addition, it proves I'm not a complete social recluse, as I extend my frail hand towards the door knob leading to the front door - cowered in complete fear.

Regardless, we were talking about our lives and discussing what personal philosophies we live by, and I managed to come up with two different philosophies that really help me get through life.

Which I will obviously reveal soon. 

I've been thinking a lot about the personal philosophies I follow in my life, because they're something I rely on heavily.

Of course, previously I'd always thought that personal philosophies were bullshit. 

To me they were meaningless preamples that had no value, beyond a temporary confidence boost that would fade as quickly as it had arrived. 

In retrospect I realise it's because I hadn't discovered any philosophies that were truly personal, nor applicable to myself and the challenges I was facing in life.

Which is to say that these two philosophies may not be applicable to you. 

Both of these philosophies relate to each other in different ways. 

The two philosophies I live my life by are:

"Life never gets any easier." 

"Everybody goes through and experiences the same thing."

Okay. 

I get it.

You're probably as completely underwhelmed, just as I am right now. 

And trust me, it sounded a lot cooler in my head, but 

I'll explain the significance of these philosophies, however first I want to talk about what philosophies are and how to make the most of them. 

Before then, just a really, really quick primer on what philosophies are and how I use them.





### Philosophy #1: Life Never Gets Any Easier

This is probably the philosophy I rely on the most.

I rely on my philosophies 


When I'm in a difficult situation, I can rely on these two philosophies to provide me with confidence in my choices. 


It can help to think of personal philosophies as simple reminders. 

Nothing more. Nothing less. 

You don't have to live your every, single moment according to a philsophy .
