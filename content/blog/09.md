 adulthood doesn't have a feeling. 




I suppose one of the glaring issues with adulthood is that there's no dramatic shift that takes place. 



Obviously, there's no one way to adult.

Some of us work respectible, full-time jobs helping others, while some are crack addicts, who would happily roll you for the pipe. 

Adults are human, which means adults are flawed. 

It's important that we explore the topic of being adult, because a) It's something we must inevitably face and b) It's something we're forced into for a vast majority of our existence. 

The truth is that it's something most of us are unprepared for. 

...which often leads to acting like a complete spastic into your early 20s. 

However there's also a subtle beauty to being an adult, which I think needs to be cherished and embraced. 

Today I want to talk about what it means to be an adult, because I think it's something ill-defined.

Not only in this quest to become a better adult, but also to allow you to live more effectively as a human being as well. 

Because guess what? 

Society functions on the basis of adulthood and if you don't adjust, you're going to get crushed. 

It doesn't matter whether you want to become a comedian, or a doctor, or just a plain ol' joe. 

If you can't get the basics right, you're basically screwed. 

You're gonna be overweight. You're going be depressed and mentally ill. You're not going to have a career. You're going to have no charisma. 

In a lot of cases, people will get everything right - except they'll be addicted to drugs or overweight or \<Insert Problem Here\>

I know, life sucks. It's hard. 

But I really have no idea how to convey the kind of urgency required when it comes to basic adulting. 

The problem is that a lot of us grew up with shitty adult figures who didn't embrace the power of adulthood. 

Who quite frankly, were shit adults. 

Who were lazy, had no aspirations, and who suffered and who normalised this suffering as a basic fact of life. 

Instead we're going to focus on the positive, enabling attributes of being an adult, because life's too short to worry otherwise.


### Adulthood Is Your Skills + Attitude

![Adulthood Is Your Skills + Attitude](/img/blog/07-02.png)

Adulthood comes down to two different aspects which compliment each other:

Skills and attitude.

You're basically worthless to society without any skills, unless if you're exceeding attractive, funny or wealthy - which brings us to our second point.

Your skills, or perhaps your amazingly gorgeous face or your stunning wit, is useless without the right attitude towards life.

Both areas are vital and often we lack in one or the other. 

We can be amazing at building things, yet not have the social or marketing skills to be able to sell our creations.  

We can have an amazing network of people, yet not have the products or skills to sell to them.

In a lot of cases, we can be talented - though incredibly arrogant and cynical, and this can destroy us. 

Put simply, there's a lot that can go wrong and in a lot of cases, we're not ready to adult. 

For a lot of people, there's a kind of transition phase between being a child and being an adult. 

Where we have the ability to become an adult, however there's no urgency or understanding of why it's truly important to commit. 

We still feel as if we're exploring the world and that finding a career or 

The problem is that after a while, we don't know how to commit - or we feel afraid to commit. 

Well, it comes down to those two things: Either you feel like you don't have the skills required OR you don't have the attitude to actually wing it and make it a reality. 

In most cases attitude is usually the limiting factor.

Quite simply because, we have zero expectations of what it means to be an adult and so we don't convey ourselves effectively. 

Why?

Because we didn't have the adults in our lives to guide us and explain this stuff to us. 

Of course, skill is important too. 




### Embracing Adulthood

Now while these are the things that make us adult, in practice it's not as easy as simply undesrtanding what needs to be done.

So here's some insight into what personally helps me be myself:


I mean, god knows how much time I spend writing these articles

#### Work Won't Always Suck

First let's address the big elephant in the room: The perception of work and working full-time .

Here's what I can tell you: Your first few years working are probably going to suck.

Because ultimately we a) Have no real idea what we want to do in life and b) Hated the petty jobs we have experienced in life. 

However that's simply part of the process of growing up. 

On the flip side, there's something I can guarantee you:

There's a job out there that's within your reach, and something you'll love doing. 

It might be your first job 


#### You Will Be Exhausted

At the end of the day, a lot of adulthood is about routine and grind.

And by gosh, committment to routine and grind is one of our biggest fears as millenials. 

The idea of working 9-to-5 terrifies us. 

I mean, 

Here's what you'll learn as an adult: You don't have the resources, but you find the resources. 

You'll never have enough time to do everything, yet the power of being an adult is that you work hard and you find the time. 

As a result, you end up getting more done, because the urgency drives you to squeeze every second of your life. 


#### You Won't Always Want To Adult

Inevitably there are times where you will no longer want to adult.

Where you'll be fed up with looking after yourself, cleaning the floors for the eighth time, or even dealing with people in general. 







### Changing Your Attitude

For a lot of people, their attitude is the biggest thing they suffer from, which prevents them from becoming an effective adult. 

It was largely what I suffered from, and so it's 



By far the biggest thing to manage is your own perception.
