<!-- 
On growing Up With Two Fathers
-->

I wanted to write this post in dedication to Gordon Huang, who unfortunately passed away two years ago. 

It's an incredibly difficult topic for me to write about, but I'll try and push ahead. 

Gordon was my dad. 

I loved him as my dad. I knew him as my dad. He was awesome dad, and a dad I'm grateful for.

Technically though, I had two dads. 

There was my biological father, and then there was Gordon. 

(along with a backdrop of terrible father figures)

The thing was, I never really saw my biological father all that much in my youth, and we more-or-less haven't kept in contact since I was eight years old. 

Certainly, he's tried to keep in contact. 

But I honestly couldn't care less about him.

Not that it mattered, because I had Gordon - who was actually driven and had a good moral sense of reality. 

Then at some point, Gordon stopped being my dad. 

Okay, this is where it gets weirder. 

You see, Gordon and my mother weren't romantically related (it wasn't that kind of relationship).

I just remember living in the same house together at one point. 

Actually, I should probably explain. 

I moved house a lot as a kid, and details aren't clear to me. 

In prep I lived with my mother and my biological father in Kallista.

Then in grade one I lived with my mother and Gordon in Ringwood, where I didn't see my biological father at all. 

In grade two I lived in Lilydale with just Gordon, where I periodically saw my mother and I still didn't see my biological father at all. 

Then in grade three, I moved back to Kallista with my biological father and my mother. 

At some point during that year my biological father and my mother split, and he left the house.

I would periodically go to see my father at random points during the year, however my mother demonised him and so I was afraid of him. 

I last saw him in grade four, when I told him I no longer wanted to see him.

However, from grade three to grade five I would spend the weekend at Gordon's house.

And as a child that was awesome, because it's where I got to play with Lego and play Playstation. 

Then two things happened. 

Gordon found a partner and decided to have children. 

Which would have been okay, if his partner didn't completely hate me. 

The other thing is that Gordon and my mother had a falling out. 

Again, I have zero idea about the details. It just is what it is. 

That was the thing with my mother is that she would keep so much a secret, that I just had no idea. 

So around about grade five I stopped speaking to him, 

And I wasleft with nothing. 

To complicate things even further  


 and he was one of the best parents I could have had. y




I suppose today I want to write about fathers.

One thing that can help is to view ourselves as being no different between you and me.

People make awful logicians.

One of the biggest logical fallacies we make, and one that has very significant consequences, is this idea that arguments are one dimensional. 

For example, we believe either that someone either hates us or likes us. 

Yet we don't think in the possibility that maybe it's because we hate or like ourselves.
