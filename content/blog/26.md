<!-- On Growing Up With Two Fathers & In Memory Of Gordon Huang -->

<!-- While a seemingly innocent post. 

May be frought with traces of kidnapping, ransom and sexual abuse. 
 -->

I wanted to write this post in dedication to Gordon Huang. 

Who unfortunately passed away two years ago. 

It's an incredibly difficult topic for me to write about, however I'll try and push ahead. 

Gordon was my dad. 

I loved him as my dad. I knew him as my dad. He was awesome dad, and a dad I'm grateful for.

Technically though, I had two dads.

Here is my story.


### Growing Up

![Growing Up](/img/blog/17-01.png)


There was my biological father, and then there was Gordon. 

(along with a backdrop of terrible father figures that would require a novel to dissect)

The thing was, I never really saw my biological father all that much in my youth.

And we more-or-less haven't kept in contact since I was eight years old. 

Certainly, he's tried. 

But we don't have many memories, and my mother certainly made an effort to turn them into shit.

I mean, not that it mattered because in my eyes, Gordon was my father. 

A person who actually had morals and was ambitious and hard working, unlike my biological father who was a drunk.

Then things changed.

At some point in my life, Gordon stopped being my dad. 

Okay, this is where it gets a little weird. 

You see, Gordon and my mother weren't romantically related (it wasn't that kind of relationship).

We just sort of lived together in the same house, at certain points in my life. 

I should probably explain. 

I moved house a lot as a kid, and reasons why aren't clear to me. 

In prep I lived with my mother and my biological father in Kallista.

Then in grade one I lived with my mother and Gordon in Ringwood, where I literally didn't see my biological father at all. 

It's like he sort of disappeared from my life. 

In grade two I lived in Lilydale with just Gordon, where I periodically saw my mother, and still didn't see my biological father. 

Then in grade three, I moved back to Kallista with my biological father and my mother.

At some point during that year my biological father left.

I would periodically go to see him at random points during the year, however my mother demonised him and so I was afraid of him. 

I last saw him in grade four, where I told him that I no longer wanted to see him.

At the same time, from grade three to grade five I would spend the weekend at Gordon's house.

And as a child that was awesome, because it's where I got to play with Lego and play Playstation. 

Then in grade five, two things happened. 

Gordon found a partner and decided to have children. 

Which would have been okay, if it weren't for the fact that his partner was awful.

She absolutely hated me, and certainly didn't treat me as one of her own.  

The other thing is that Gordon and my mother had a falling out. 

Again, I have zero idea about the details. It just is what it is. 

My mother keeps almost everything a secret, which is probably why I value communication most in my life. 

Hell, it's probably the reason for why I write this website. 

### Sculptor

![Sculptor](/img/blog/17-02.png)

Gordon was a sculptor. 

He was an incredibly talented one. 

If you live in Melbourne and ever visit China Town, there's a section (I would define it as a square) with a statue of    - the founder of modern China. 

He created that statue and I visit it everytime I'm in the area. 

And it makes me emotional. 

Unfortunately, a by-product of his art was that he would inhale an incredidle amount of dust.

Not to mention all the chemicals and fumes that went into producing moulds etc. 

So he developed lung cancer when I was in grade three.

It's weird as a kid, because you don't think about things like death or tradegy. 

I was in the hospital with his children when they found out about his death, and they seemed almost unphased. 

Like there was nothing they could do, but more that it 'this was reality' and there was nothing really to comprehend.

The initial tumor they discovered was unique.

According to doctors, it was the second largest lung tumor in the world. 

The size of a football, occupying his lungs.

So naturally he had surgery to cut out the tumor, and thankfully it was successful.

Unfortunately the cancer was malignant, which meant they had to continue performing surgery over the years.

Each time, cutting out another piece of his lung.

I suppose the thing I hated most as a kid was that we could never really do outdoor things.

He couldn't really ride a bike for too long or be physically involved. 

I remember post-surgery being particularly terrifying. 

Once he was well enough to return home, he was still somewhat bed-ridden and his father looked after him. 

One of the side-effects of the operation was that he had incredibly low blood-sugar.

And they would make him take these tubes of sugar that he absolutely hated. 

At home he was encourged to drink bottles of fruit juice.

What was terrifying was the way he acted when his blood-sugar level was too long. 

He literally went mad. 

Like, proper insane. 

He acted like an ape and would shout things and then turn aggressive. 

### Why Is Compassion So Hard? 

![Why Is Compassion So Hard?](/img/blog/17-01.png)

The the I appreciate the most about Gordon was that he was a good role model. 

It's interesting when you think about role models, because I never really thought about things like role models or philosophies as a kid. 

Personally I've found that it's only been later in life, where I've been in a difficult situation and need to look up to someone, that role models have been a necessary thing. 

He didn't drink. He didn't smoke.

He was a strong father figure.

I think this story demonstrates that. 

When I was around 20 years old, I decided to run away from home.

(HA. Now there's a story for another time.)

I wasn't quite sure where to go, so I decided to call him. 

It was awkward, because I hadn't seen him in close to ten years. Regardless, I still felt compelled to call. 

Anyway, it was night time when the cops had decided to show up. 

They called for me on their megaphone, and he went outside and told them that I wasn't there. 

Even when they said they would come inside to search he sit said I wasn' there. 







Like most things, it was never perfect.

I remeber.
