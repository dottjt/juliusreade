Committing towards a full-time job is one of the most fundamental things you can do in life to secure your future success.

Not because of the money or the tireless hours spent making someone else rich. 

Those things are inconsequential to the true benefits of working full-time. Benefits which are incredibly difficult to replicate in other systems. 

Blah. Blah. Blah.

Though perhaps you already know this.

Perhaps you've already experienced first-hand the crushing resilience that full-time work forces upon you. 

That's cool. You keep at it.  

The rest of us however probably need a bit of guidance.

You may not have been brought up with hard-working role models, let alone role models who worked at all.

Certainly, I wasn't one to appreciate full-time work until much later in life - largely as a result of the work ethic (or lack thereof) of the people in my life growing up. 

Rather than praise full-time work as a boon to creativity and productivity, I instead viewed it as a complete waste of time.

Not only did I view it as a burden on my learning and my ability to enjoy life, however I also viewed it as a burden on my potential to get ahead in life. 

Oh, how I was so wrong. 

Well, both right and wrong. So let's talk about it. 

In this article I aim to explore the hidden and perhaps unrealised benefits of working full-time, in order to help you understand why full-time work it is so essential for your success. 

After all, the primary purpose for this blog is to help you become as successful as quickly as possible.

Otherwise I wouldn't be recommending it.

Well actually... I may have been lying a little there. 

Working full-time isn't the best way to become successful. 

The best way to become successful is to have amazingly supportive parents, as well as a wealth of friends, connections and money to help you pursue your dreams and goals. 

Though chances are, you haven't quite been so blessed. 

In fact, you probably have shitty parents, an overbearing mental illness (or two), as well as a whole bunch of regrets you've been trying repress since childhood. 

For you and me, working full-time is the next best thing. 

Of course, with a few strict guidelines. 

For example, you should always keep full-time work to a minimum - enough to help you pursue your goals without consuming all your time. 

In most cases this means working 9-to-5, Monday to Friday. 

And weekends should definitely be off-limits to allow you to do other things, like recuperate or study some more.  

Okay, I know. I know. 

Eight hours seems like a massive chunk of time to suck out of your daily schedule.

But as you'll discover - not is all as it seems. 

And of course, like most things in life, full-time work should only be viewed as a temporary solution in the grander scheme of your success. 

Remember - your end goal should be to make money doing something you love, from a passive income or even your own business.

<!-- article on passive income -->

Something which full-time work should assist you with greatly. 

And if you do already enjoy your work in a field you love, here is how you can make it better. 

### The Theory: Under Pressure

![The Story Of How My Pornography Addiction Began](/img/blog/03-01.png)

So you have ambitions. 

That's cool n' all, but how do you turn those ideas into a reality? 

You work on them. 

You bust a gut doing everything you can to ensure these ambitions are being worked on actively to the best of your ability.

You study. You read obsessively. You cut out all the crap in your life holding you back. 

Ideally, you would be working on these ambitions full-time, right? 

Logically it makes sense.

Unfortunately, the logistics of being a human simply don't pan out.

We get distracted. We burnout. We stop caring. We wake up at 6am each day, as scheduled, only to fall back asleep. 

For the most part, we are dysfunctional from the point of view of success.

Not that it's your fault. 

Success itself is a fallacy - a delusion driven by society to sustain the illusion of meaning and purpose that is civilization. 

But we're not here to question why you're doing it. We all have our reasons. Some valid, others absurd. 

We're here to change and to make it work.

In order to do this, we're going to need something full-proof. Something that will work 100 per cent of the time. 

We need to think primal. We need to think about what works for dumb animals, otherwise we're just going to end up with the same bullshit we've been trying to avoid for years - even more mental illness. 

Really, what we need is a system. 

An integral structure of incentives, checks and balances so that 100 per cent time, you don't end up sleeping in till 10am or sitting around feeling depressed about the fact that your dad touched you.

In other words, a routine. 

And guess what? 

For most people full-time work provides that perfect routine/structure.

What really works is to think of ourselves as really dumb animals. 

Really. Fucking. Dumb. Animals. 

Dumb animals that can need to be trained and guided, to think and believe. 

Because that's what we are. Helpless, incapable animals who can barely figure out how not to break down into a slurry of guilt and emotion.

Fuck that. 

We're going to fix it.  

### The Theory: The Value Of Accountability
![The Story Of How My Pornography Addiction Began](/img/blog/03-02.png)

The fact is, most of us simply don't function without some sort of structure or pressure in life. 

Specifically, a structure in which we are accountable for our own actions. 

We eat (and starve) ourselves to death, become far too easily addicted and suffer needlessly because of our beliefs of what the world should be. 

As a pornography addict, I will literally sit there and masturbate myself to death - even if it threatens my long-term survival. I just can't help it.

Yet it doesn't mean anything, because our survival in society doesn't depend on how functional or reasonable we can be. 

What full-time work aims to do is to serve as a stepping stone, to allow us to setup up our own system of accountability so we can feel that pressure to change. 

A system in which you are accountable to your boss, to your co-workers, to your clients, and most importantly: To Yourself. 

It's the reason religion works so well from a structural point of view. "God is always watching, so please don't be a dick".

And the more accountability, the better. 

Accountability is important because it teaches you to take your life seriously. 

It teaches you to value your time and effort in life, not as something inconsequential, but as something meaningful with significant impact on your life. 

Living out of home without financial support? Even better, because now you're accountable for your own financial independence.

Of course, it's also the reason why full-time work is so daunting to a lot of people. It's a completely different way of thinking about life, which few people will appreciate until after they've been working for a while.

<!-- ### natural break point -->

You see, humans don't need options in life. 

Humans need pathways. They need accountability. They need commitment. 

What most people don't realise is that these options only come later in life once you've committed towards something.

What makes this notion of committment so difficult is that most people won't commit out of good will or because they understand that it's what's "best" for their future.

And arguably, most people won't commit without some sort of pressure, and that's what we're going to recreate with full-time work. 

The pressure to force us to make the most of the options available to us, so we can create more options and choices for what we want to do later in life. 

The pressure to take action, because once you realise that action is the only thing that success cares about, you no longer pay any attention to your depression or self-perceived limitations.

They simply no longer become relevant to your survival.  

Instead, your survival and responsibility towards becoming successful in life become relevant. 

Of course, not everyone is like this. 

Again, it is about creating a system that is full-proof, rather than something for people who are already ideal. 

Because when you've got depression or a few mental health issues, you'll need all the help you can get. 

The reason why systems (or routines) are effective is that they make our responsibility to ourselves and others feel "real" or urgent.

And when you think about it, that's all humans really care about - their association with reality and how it makes them feel. 

It's the reason why you go back to sleep at 6am and wake up at 10am, rather than fully wake up as scheduled. 

Your tiredness feels very "real" in the moment, even if you know it's just a feeling and not in your best interest.

With a system in place however, the pressure and consequence of not waking up at 6am in order to get to work on time feels very "real" and convincing. 

Initially, it is about associating our behaviours with our emotions, so we can have the pressure to take the actions necessary for our success.  

It is important to note that this focus on our emotions is merely an intermediary step to accustom ourselves with our routine. 

What's truly important is the repetition of our routine. The doing. The action. 

Because success doesn't care about how you feel. It only cares about your actions, and learning to dissociate yourself from your emotions is key to becoming efficient. 

The less thinking, the better - because it saves you the mental overload of having study. 

Once your routine develops, you'll no longer care whether something feels real or not. 

Instead, you can begin to relate to your life from the point of view of your actions, and this makes you very powerful. 

It is a mindset that allows you to choose how you feel no matter what you are experiencing, though this is a talk for another time. 

<!-- transcending your emotions. They're just silly think things -->

Ultimately, a full-time job provides you with the understanding that your responsibility towards yourself is far greater than any other agenda you have going on in your mind.

And of course, this isn't to discount or forget all the horrible things that may have happened to you in life. 

Systems are simply processes that allow us to overcome these debilitating aspects of our personality - allowing us to pursue success without setback. 

Nothing less. Nothing more. 

### The Practice: Routine Salad 

![The Story Of How My Pornography Addiction Began](/img/blog/03-03.png)

Of course, that's just the theory. 

What you really need are some tips on how to make it work. 

So take the parts you want and customise your approach. I don't have all the answers, as all our lives are inevitably different.

The main reason we're pursuing full-time work is to establish a routine for us to excel in. 

This means doing the same things, at the same set time, everyday. 

Now aside from the pressure that full-time work provides, the structure of full-time work itself works quite well. 

Not only is five days of work is a good place to start, however as time progresses you'll more-or-less be able to study and work constantly all-week round. 

Though baby steps, baby. Always start with a reasonable outlook and break things down into small chunks.

<!-- break things down into small chunks --> 

While any full-time job is better than no full-time job, some full-time jobs are more conducive than others when it comes to preparing us for success.

Ideally, what we want is a job that's menial, where you can sit in front of a computer, and probably get away with studying over the internet when no one's around.

In other words, a job where you can largely conserve your energy, so that you can you can focus it where it's important - on your study once work is over. 

If it's the kind of job where you can touch-type and keep your eyes closed while working - even better. 

Though these details are minor, as I'm sure you have your own ideas of where you would like to work, as well as where you'd like to see your career.

<!-- A millennial's guide to getting a job -->

Now arguably, the most important aspect of working full-time is being able to engage in quality study with your time not spent working. 

As part of this routine, I personally find the best time to study is before and after work whilst on public transport. 

This works well for a number of reasons. 

I've found that studying whilst on public transport can help in providing you with a sense of urgency. A sense of simulated importance in what you're doing. 

You see, when you're traveling somewhere it creates this effect of making you want to work and get stuff done.

Part of it is because you feel as if your time is limited, like you need to make the most of the your time before you arrive at your destination. 

It doesn't feel endless or open ended. It feels like a challenge you've set yourself up for. 

Another large and important consequence of this effect is that it prevents you from getting bored while studying.

As a result, you can more-or-less study for hours on end without burning out - unlike at home or at the library where things can begin to feel dreary after 30 minutes. 

In addition, as part of your routine, you will begin to associate your time on public transport with your learning, which allows you to mentally seperate your study time with your leisure time.

Though perhaps you drive to work.

Don't.

Honestly, I don't know how else to say it. 

Arguably time driving is time not spent engaging in quality study time, and when you're working full-time, it truly highlights how little time you have. 

Of course, this is just me and this may not apply to you if you live really close to your workplace. 

You see, I intentionally pursued a job that was incredibly far away from where I live so I could spend more time studying on public transport.

In addition, I also take a bus route that takes twice as long than if I were to take the quickest route, for the very same reasons. 

I'm sure you could simply wake up early and study, however it's something I've personally struggled to make work.

Instead, I've found the urgency of public transport to be a huge boon to my ability to study and concentrate.

Take it for what you will. 

Now my work hours are from 8:30am to 5:00pm.

By waking up at 6:00am, it effectively provides me with around 1 hour 45 minutes worth of quality study time each way. 

6:00am works well because it provides me with 8 hours of sleep, as well as enough time to chill with my girlfriend, workout and get chores done once I get home, to be in bed by 10pm. 

Don't forget - working out n' maintaining your health is equally as important as your study. Balance is the key to success.  

Including additional study during my lunch break, in total I get around 4 hours of quality study time each day.

While it doesn't sound like much - it's actually quite a lot. 

Part of it has to do with how we learn and retain information, and I'll write a seperate article on how you can develop an ideal learning routine at a later stage.

<!-- An intuitive guide to studying that works -->

The main reason being that there are only so many things you can learn/memorise each day, so dedicating 45 minutes to 4-to-5 topics each day works well in terms of learning retention.

Of course, the truth is that the whole full-time work paradigm is something that takes a lot of patience and practice.

The very first year of full-time work was a struggle for me, however in my second year I learnt to embrace my routine and now in my third year - I absolutely dominate with my study, focus and motivation to succeed. 

The other thing I like about full-time work is that it's buffer for when you're feeling depressed and if you have 

Also, let's not forget the money. The money it provides is helpful, too - though think of money as a side-benefit: 

Your time and knowledge will be much more valuable in the long run. 

Certainly, full-time work isn't the be all or end all of becoming successful. 

It is merely a structural framework that makes pursuing your goals seem easy. 

And that's it. 

I hope you liked the article. 

PS: I wrote a post script of why I didn't grow up with a strong "work ethic", however I've left it till the end of this article since I felt it wasn't entirely relevant, though interesting none-the-less.

### Post Script: Childhood

![The Story Of How My Pornography Addiction Began](/img/blog/03-05.png)

My parents didn't have traditional jobs in the 9-to-5 sense. 

My mother was an artist and my father... well, he didn't really stick around long enough for me to really understand what he did, though I think his work was in the same vein. 

Half the time they would simply be louging around, which affected my perception of what being an adult was. 

Another part of the equation is that I never really grew up with a strong sense of study culture in the family. 

Instead, I was consistently praised with a "you're so smart, you can do anything" attitude, which is utterly toxic. 

I was always told that I was brilliant and that I could do anything if I put my mind to it, yet at no point was I really explained how to actually "put my mind to it".

This was okay in primary school when things weren't too bad and you could largely get things done with effort alone.

However later on you simply crumble, because you were taught any effect techniques about scheduling your time or breaking tasks down into segments.

In fact, my mother would end up doing most of the major end-of-year assignments for me in primary school, completely out of my will. 

For example in grade one I remember that I had to build a model house (it was a massive fucking task at the time) and she ended up taking over and building the entire thing herself. 

Then it got to the point by grade three that I didn't have the skills to do these things and I had no choice but to get her to do it for me. 

What I think would have really helped is if we all sat at the dinner table and learned things together. 

Unfortunately, it was a culture which was delegated away to private institutions, rather than properly enforced in the home.

I would go to Saturday school on the weekends, yet I could barely do the homework because my parents couldn't provide me with that support. 

But of course, my mother wasn't particularly educated and was terrible at these things, so it wouldn't have helped at all. 

So rather than do my homework, I would just play on my gameboy instead. 

Then as I got older I had zero idea of what "work" or "careers" even were, as all my mother's friends were artists as well.

Hell, I didn't even realise what an account manager or 'digital strategist' was until recently. 

In a sense, the business world to me was almost like travelling to a foreign country. 

I just didn't understand any of it. 

So yeah, I think at the very least it's made me realise what my children require and how best to raise them. 

It is what it is. Life evolves and continues. 

<!--
UNUSED BITS



Of course, there was also the lack of communication with my mother and growing isolation between us as I got older.

We never talked or shared anything and we still don't till this day. 

Part of it was my fear of judgement and criticism from her, so I kept my mouth shut, even when she wanted to know more about me, though that's a story for another time. 

So I was basically fucked


 where do you start? 

Another part of the problem is that people don't think in terms of systems. 

They are instead stuck in the world of ideals, where things are explained in terms of the desired outcome, rather than the process. 

Truth is, the process is all that matters. 


Ultimately, what I think you'll discover from this article is an understanding of why frameworks and routines are important for solidifying certain behaviours and routines. 

That processes are equally as important as our ideas, no matter how self-determined or confident we think we really are.


Another part of my aversion towards hard work may have had to do with the gargantuan chores I had to partake in my youth, that were borderline child-labor. 

Even with my goals and ambitions I'm still a shitty, helpless animal who continues to disassociate from reality and fuck shit up.  


Because the reality is that humans, like myself, aren't so smart or efficient.

We eat (and starve) ourselves to death, become far too easily addicted and suffer needlessly because of our beliefs of what the world should be. 

As a pornography addict, I will literally sit there and masturbate myself to death - even if it threatens my long-term survival. I can't help it.



The reason why full-time work is such a perfect system for achieving success if quite simple: Your survival depends upon it. 

Still living at home with the fam? 

Move out of home. Financial independence within itself is another system which relies on your ability to survive, which benefits apply for the same reason as full-time work. 


There are a few core reasons why this is structure or routine is so effective, at least as a starter pack for those wanting to become something more. 

Now let's look at the alternative if you weren't to have a job at all, and it's largely based on my own experience of being a shitty human being:

You wake up at 9am because you have no real incentive to wake up. I mean, not that you don't want to study, but in the heat of the moment sleep seems more important. 

You eventually get your shit together and you try to study, but you get 40 minutes in before being bored or distracted. 

I mean, what's the point? All this stuff is going to affect me in the future, so why is any of this important?

I always found I would peak early, around after lunch. The problem is that I would sit in front of the computer for 3 hours at a time and burn out. 

There was no pressure to get anything done. No bus to feel like I was moving or going someone. No purpose.

I had all the time in the world, yet I couldn't make it work. Of course, this is also considering that I'm rather average, probably like you.

Certainly, if it's one thing I've learnt, it's that the psychology is especially important. 

Aftera ll, why did you break down into a human jelly ball when your first relationship fell apart? 

Feelings. Those fucking feelings.


Excellent. That then makes you a psychopath which poses a whole range of problems which will end up destroying you in the long run. 

For the rest of us, it's much preferred if you simply 


When you think about it, life doesn't present much opportunity to be challenged from the point of view of our actual survival. 

We live in a largely safe world, driven by health standards, regulations, the law, road systems - configurations in place to prevent us (mostly) from being harmed and killed. 

At the same time, we've become so normalised to this system that we've also lost the value of being accountable for our own actions, at least on an individual level.
