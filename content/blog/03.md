The aim of this article is to explain how working full-time is one of the most amazing skills you will ever learn.

I grew up with an intense hatred for work. 

My first proper job was as a flower picker at the age of 14 on a small farm in the local area (admittedly, I didn't exactly live in the burbs').

As part of my job I was largely responsible for cutting and bunching the flowers so that they were ready for market. 

It was during summer where the days were hot, long and entirely unbearable. And fuck it, I was 14 years old. I just wanted to play video games and masturbate to pornography.

In fact, I hated work so much that I wouldn't find my first proper job until I was 19, where I managed to find a position working at a McDonald's behind the front counter. 

Ever since then I've worked a variety of equally unbearable jobs. Retail. Telemarketing. Events. PR. All valuable, though equally meaningless jobs.  

I viewed it as a complete waste of one's time. In fact, I largely believed the only reason I went to University was so I could avoid full-time work. 

Now, I doubt I can live without it and for good reason, that largely debunks all my fears and worries about pushing paper for a dollar or two. 

The aim of this piece is to make you understand how full-time work will benefit you. 

Full-time work will change your life is way


Here's the deal kid. 

Now I see work as invaluable.
