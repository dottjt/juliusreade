Today I want to write about the ways in which I maintain my self-awareness.

Like, a breakdown of what I do in my head to ensure my mental health is in tip-top shape. 

Previously, I suppose my writings have been about the theory behind what I do and why.

Which is great an all for me, however the truth is, theory isn't very useful. 

What a lot of people don't realise about things like self-awareness (and a lot of other skills).

Is that they're largely a practice.

You don't get good at drawing by looking at pictures. 

You get good at drawing through technical study and practice.

(i'm currently learning to draw, if that helps)

Otherwise it all just becomes a glob of mental masturbation. 

The worst kind of masturbation where even your hand looks down upon you.

So let's get into the nitty gritty. 

The do's and don'ts. 

(surely don'ts isn't an actual word?)

Although certainly, don't expect too much from this article. 

It took me four years to finally understand this shit, so to be quite frank, I'm writing this for myself. 

Under the guise I'm actually helping others. 

### Attitude

I want to focus in on this idea of attitude, because I think it sums up almost everything.

If you want to be happy, you literally just have to be happy.

It's literally that simple.

You smile, you think of something that makes you happy, and you're already 100% of the way there. 

That's it. 

You don't have to go to Mexico for a spiritual experience

Why do't we get there?

### Self-Awareness

Now we can understand realise that the aim of addressing mental illness is more clear. 

Precisely, it is about learning to control our virtual reality.

By dissolving our beliefs and returning our personal power back to ourselves. 

How does one do this?

Well, through self-awareness. 

What is self-awareness? 

Fundamentally, self-awareness is about teaching you to remain skeptical.

Being skeptical is what allows you to be in touch with your consciousness.

It is applied skepticism. 

Because the tricky thing about consciousness, is    that it tends to automate itself.

Which is a big no no, because that's how we end up creating delusion.



Of course, the way we do it is very subtle and part of mental illness recovery is uncovering these hidden beliefs. 

Often, these beliefs appear within the way we use our language. 

When we say 'this person makes me feel sad' or 'I feel guilty because of these particular events'. 

We tell ourselves the lie that these external events are 


And yet these statements are merely lies we tell ourselves.

Labels we use to describe the world around us. 

Now you may be wondering...


For instance, it means being able to control our thoughts and emotions.

By creating and destroying them at our will. 

It means being able to connect with our thoughts and emotions with the beliefs which underpin them. 

The interesting thing I find is that as time goes along.

My definition of self-awareness changes, as does my understanding of how to achieve it. 

There's a few things I do to practice self-awareness.

I try and take note of where my attention is, and from which point of view I am taking on that thing. 

I try and recognise emotional reactions, as well as where I abdicate my power.

(for example, when I catch myself staring at hot women in public)

I practice the creation of emotion, particularly through gratitude exercises. 

There's a lot of things I do, to try and keep on top of myself. 

Meditation is an important one, where I aim to maintain my attention.

The interesting thing, and the reason why I've never really succeeded with my mental health.

Is that I'll come to these realisations, and yet I'll forget to be self-aware and it's like this premise will disappear completely. 

The reason why I've managed to be successful with my self-awareness this time eludes me.

Perhaps it's because I'm already in a good place, and so I find myself less distracted by the horrors from my past. 

On the other hand, I think it's because I'm a lot more focused and mature today, than I used to be.

I have clear goals and ambitions. 

And because of that, I recognise the importance of my mental health.

Not only for my general welfare, however also as a tool for efficiency. 

Perhaps we are all still bastards at the end of the day.

Oh, you silly words <3
