It's been over one year since I decided to disown my mother. 

I don't speak to her. I don't visit her. I don't respond to her messages. 

She doesn't even know where I live, and I hope to keep it this way. 

I've done everything imaginable to block her out of my life, and it's something I'll continue to do into the future. 

If I had to describe my relationship with my mother, I would say that it was toxic. 







I suppose I'm writing this article to explain why I did it. 

Why I decided to leave my mother, and why I think I probably couldn't go back.

Certainly, I don't like her. 

I don't think I ever have.

I would argue that she's largely responsible for my depression.

In the way I was treated and brought up. 

We didn't communicate, at all. 

I didn't love her. 

It was an intricate system of loyalty more-than-anything, and it was churning me on the inside. 

I was reading through old journals, where I would detail the agony of her prescence. 

The hard thing is that I know she loves me, however I don't think that detracts from the harm she causes. 



### Why It Probably Wouldn't Work

![Why It Probably Wouldn't Work](/img/blog/13-01.png)

I left my mother for a very simple reason.

She was negatively impacting my mental health, and I believe there is nothing more important than a person's mental health. 



There are a few things wrong with my mother. 

Firstly, she's a deeply flawed human being. 

She takes everything personally. She's irrational. She doesn't communicate. She things she's inherently more important than everyone else. 

I remember being told as a child that "my time is more important than yours" which is so fucked. 

Another issue is that she does not change. 

Maybe it's an intelligence thing, or a generational thing, however she's stuck in her ways. 

Maybe this is Asian culture. Well fuck, all the more reason to leave. 

What I think is bullshit is that 







I'd been planning it for a while.

My plan was to gather enough stuff to move out of home, and then suddenly disappear. 

Part of the plan was getting my girlfriend and friend onboard, so we could rent a place to live. 




People do things for all sorts of reasons. 

I don't think they necessarily know why they do those things, however they do them. 



This is always a tough subject. 

"It's complicated".
