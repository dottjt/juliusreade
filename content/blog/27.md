Let's Make Obsession Rational Again

You're obsessive.

I know it. 

Because everyone's obsessed with something. 

Personally speaking, I'm obsessed with finding ways to taunt reality.

I'm pusher, you know. 

I will push and pull and tangle your strings, just to see what might happen.

In an attempt to shatter the fabric of reality we're all so familiar with.

I'm obsessed with sex and perversion. 

I'm obsessed with my first girlfriend. 

I'm obsessed with awkward situations. 

And much like myself, chances are that you're obsessed with things that don't help you become more functional as a person.

Rather than be obsessed with the good you can do in life.

You're obsessed with addiction and wanting to break that fourth wall to see what happens when you stick a needle in your arm. 

Certainly, I've come to discover that's everyone. 

Everyone dreams of violently redefining their status quo.

Yet we think it can be achieved by downing a whole cake, whilst drunkingly despising the whole world in a regret of pain and ache. 

And sure, that's one way to do it. 

The only problem is that's how most people do it. 

So let's try and be destructive with a little bit of finesse, shall we? 

### Obsession Is A Human Trait
![Obsession Is A Human Trait](/img/blog/21-01.png)

I don't necessarily think obsession is a bad thing. 

Rather, I would describe it as a starting point for learning how to be sustainably passionate. 

Certainly, obsession isn't the problem. 

The problem is that it's a tool most of us fail to understand. 

And to help us understand, we have to dive into what it means to be human. 

You see, humans are curious creatures. 

We dream.

We have imagination.

We think things that we shouldn't.

And there are people in our lives that we would more than happily murder if there were no societal or emotional consequences.

It's what defines and drives us to live.

For a lot of people, this means escaping reality.

And means becoming obsessed with things our curiosity is really, really curious about.

Yet obsession implies something more than mere curiosity. 

It also implies irrationality to a large degree. 

Oh, because humans are also irrational as well!

Most of us pursue our curiosity, not because it makes any sense, but because our brain simply told us to. 

We thought, what would happen if I just went and spent $300 on shoes I don't need. 

Thinking our reality is going to fundamentally change in some significant way. 

And then we do it, and it doesn't.

Realising that it wasn't anything special at all. 

Essentially what we want to do is remove the irrationality from the obsession. 

We want to be utterly obsessed, but in a way that we consciously know what we're obsessed with. 

### Sustainable Obsession?

The way to do this is quite specific. 

And in order to make this work, we must become conscious of the things which we find obsessive. 

Because here's the thing. 

Part of what makes obsession so effective is the side which makes us irrational.

Meaning we don't really realise what's going on. 

Now that we're no longer pursing that irratinoality, we now need to be consciously aware of what goes into being obsessive.

And as you'll come to discover, in a lot of ways there's almost zero difference between being mindless and in control.

For example, irrational obsession usually entails being mindless. 

Rational obsession on the other hand entails the opposite to mindlessness - focus.

And yet they more-or-less produce the exact same effect.

Both cause you to block out the world around you. 

Both have the exact same feeling.

The only difference is that one is in-control and rational. 

While the other is out of your control, and driving by common human desires which drag us down. 

Certainly, our starting strategy should be quite simple.

We want to become obsessed with enough positive things in life so that we don't feel compelled to pursue the bad. 

Obsession works because it sucks our attention.

And to do this, we need to focus on the principles which define it. 

### Steps Towards Sustainable Obsession
![Steps Towards Sustainable Obsession](/img/blog/21-03.png)

Earlier we mentioned that feeling of being inside a vaccum. 

That's important, because it's what allows us to easily dedicate our time and attention towards our craft. 






### Sustainable Obsession?
![Sustainable Obsession?](/img/blog/21-01.png)

I think a defining moment for most people is when they realise that obsession is superficial.

Not necessarily in that it's pointless, but that it's not special. 

Which is to say that they realise that their obsession is under their control. 



Which is to say that there's a certain level of balance and 




In our pursuit we either take things too personally, or we get caught up in the hype, or we fail to stablise our emotions in the high of our obsession. 

I would simply argue that it's something we need to control. 








### Why Obsession?
![Why Obsession?](/img/blog/21-05.png)

While obsession may seem unideal, there's a few reasons why I advocate it. 

Firstly, it's a part of who we are. 

Humans are curious. Humans are irrational. 

Why not use our latest, most advanced human technology - rational thought - to try and make it better?

The reason why a lot of people find it helpful is because we're almost stuck in a kind of chicken and the egg situation.

Ideally, we wouldn't be obsessed at all. 

Ideally, would calm down and simply exist at peace with ourselves.



Secondly, it's not useless.



Lastly, it's easy. 

Obsession genuinely makes difficult things in life easy. 

Want to get really good at something? Become obsessed with it.
