Okay.

I don't want to go as far as to say that I'm no longer mentally ill.

As my views on what mental illness is has changed somewhat over the past few weeks.

However what I would like to say is that I've made some very dramatic changes in my life. 

And that I feel like a completely different person.

It's like ...I'm self-aware and completely in control of every single aspect of myself.

Now the problem, I imagine.

At least from your point of view, as the reader. 

Is that it appears that I've gone from one extreme to another. 









I have no idea how to start this post. 

I feel both completely overwhelmed, as well as completely inert.

I feel happy.

Where to begin. 

Lately I've been feeling incredibly positive about my life. 









I feel like it had something to do with the last article I wrote. 

<!-- 


So.

I had one of those moments.

I'm not exactly sure when it happened, but I think it had a lot to do with my last post.

My last post was quite personal and traumatic for me. 

I personally noticed that I was quite drawn into the story as I writing it. 

As I relived events in mind that happened many years ago.

Events that I continue to relive on a constant basis. 

And as I was writing, something sparked in my mind like a wildfire. 

This notion of empowerment which fundamentally shattered my perception of reality.

I decided at that moment that I was going to focus on my mental health.

Just as I did this same time four years ago. 

To deal with the exact same issues which having been plaguing me since then. 

And my gosh,
