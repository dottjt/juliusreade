Allow Me To Describe Why I'm No Longer Mentally Ill


I think I may have discovered how to be happy

It's taken me four years to address my mental health. 

I think I discovered how to be happy.

Holy Shit. I'm No Longer Mentally Ill. 


I just discovered what mental illness is. 
This is your mind on mental illness. 
-->


Now. 

I don't want to go as far as to say that I'm no longer mentally ill.

As it assumes a kind of permanence I cannot prove. 

However, what I would like to say.

Is that I've made some very dramatic changes over the past few weeks. 

And that as a result of those changes, I feel as if I'm a completely different person.

For example.

I'm smiling a lot more. 

Which wouldn't seem like a big deal.

If it weren't for the fact that I'm literally smiling all the time. 

In fact, I'm smiling right now.

And I highly recommend you give it a try too. 

What essentially happened is that I took this mental health course. 

(as part of https://wwww.pathwaytohappiness.com)

And it literally broke me in the best possible way. 

I'm self-aware with all my beliefs, thoughts and emotions. 

I feel as if I'm in control of every single aspect of my mind. 

And I feel genuinely happy and full of life 

It's been nothing short of life changing. 

Now the problem, I imagine.

At least from your point of view, my dear reader. 

Is it appears that I've gone from one extreme to another. 

As if I've joined some kind of ideological cult, where the idea of severe punishment entails whipping myself with a cast iron chain. 

Which is a fair assessment, and perfectly understanable provided my bipolar tendencies. 

On the other hand, please allow me to try and explain. 

Why I haven't died and gone insane. 

Because the truth is, this has been a four-year long journey for me. 

And it's been only until recent that it's all begun to make sense. 

### Virtual Reality

![Virtual Reality](/img/blog/23-01.png)

It's hard to know exactly where to start. 

And certainly, I think this article can only serve as a basic overview of the concepts I've adopted over the past month or so.  

Regardless, I think it might help if I provide you with an understanding of how we develop mental illness in the first place. 

(at least as far as I'm aware)

As it will ease you into understanding the process with which to dismantle it. 

We begin. 

I want you to imagine this idea of the virtual reality. 

This place where nothing is real, and yet appears to feel real in every sense. 

This place we create and fabricate out of our own imagination. 

Much like a dream. 

I mean, sure. We may draw inspiration from the real world within this virtual reality. 

However that isn't to say that this virtual reality is the original source of our consciousness.

A concept which I'll try to explain throughout this chapter. 

So what exactly is this virtual reality? 

Well, it can take many different forms, some easier to understand than others. 

For the sake of simplicity, let's focus on the virtual reality most of us are familiar with. 

The virtual reality of the digital, online world.

On a flat 2D surface we can literally experience the world. 

We can view images which depict scenes and places well beyond our physical location.

Play around with simulations which take us through the intricate details of human anatomy. 

Watch videos based on outlandish, fantasy worlds - with creatures that do not exist in real life. 

Play video games that allow us to control characters to achieve the impossible. 

And even witness accounts that took places hundreds of years ago within public archives. 

The online world allows you to do almost anything and everything. 

And as a result of these wonderful attributes, many of us have already become quite efficient at embracing this idea of the virtual reality. 

So much so, that many of us have now become dependent on the internet for a large majority of the information we consume and experience on a daily basis. 

Yet this online virtual experience goes far deeper than we think. 

For example, when we read something compelling online we don't just take it at face value.

We construct this conceptual imagination in our minds to connect with the information we are taking in.

An imagination which produces thoughts and emotions, which help develops our understanding of the world. 

Not necessarily because of the contents we're consuming (because almost everything online is subjective), but because of our perception of it.

Our perception and belief of what is real. 

That is, we produce a certain thought or emotional reaction because of our beliefs, even though what we are comprehending is inherently virtual. 

It could be fake news or it could be something that's happened thousands of kilometres away.

It doesn't matter. 

When we percieve the content to be compelling, due to what we believe, we treat and hold sacred the text we read on our computer screens. 

No different to the emotional reaction we recieve when we play a video game or watch a movie. 

Otherwise, slaying a virtual dragon wouldn't have a feeling. 

Instead, we would just sit there dumbfounded, realising that we're doing nothing more than mashing a bunch of plastic buttons.

In front of a flat panel screen made of metal and plastic.  

(which is actually what tends to happen over time, as I'll soon explain) 

Regardless, our imagination is what bridges this abstraction from our mechanical actions, to our virtual understanding of the world. 

Now, there's nothing particularly wrong with having these feelings or reactions towards the virtual world. 

However, what tends to happen over time, is that our sense of reality can become distorted or exaggerated by this virtual reality.

Either we can become desensitised to our virtual experiences, or we can find them overly disturbing and real. 

In both cases, we end up failing to distinguish between our real and imagined reality. 

Either rejecting the medium, or embracing it further. 

And I would say it's a conflict most of us struggle with to some degree. 

Consider something like Facebook.

This completely virtual representation of our social lives that feels as if we're truly interacting with our friends.

That can produce the same social anxiety and feeling of rejection inherent within our physical friendships. 

Even though we're literally doing nothing more than hitting a couple of button on our phones. 

In completely separate locations. 

Of course, this has all been one elaborate introduction to segue into what I actually want to talk about. 

You see, the online world is merely one example of a virtual reality. 

The other and perhaps most important example of a virtual reality.

Which many of us do not consider. 

Is the virtual reality of our minds. 

### Understanding Thoughts And Emotions

![Understanding Thoughts And Emotions](/img/blog/23-02.png)

The good news, and perhaps why we're lucky to be trying to understand mental illness in today's day and age. 

Is that most of us are already quite familiar with how virtual realities work. 

Whether we're engaging in a fantasy novel, watching a movie or reading an article online - we've become quite adept at embracing these virtual worlds. 

Which really, is bloody fantastic because it means we're already halfway to understanding how mental illness functions. 

All we have to do now is become aware of how we interact with hem. 

So, what exactly is this virtual reality of the mind? 

In broader terms, it consists of the imagined (or percieved) experiences we have of life.

More simply it consists of the thoughts and emotions we experience on a daily basis. 

In particular, I want us to focus on our thoughts.

As most of us tend to better understand our thoughts, than compared to our emotions.

(at least so we think)

Now, there are two very interesting things to note about how most of us tend to percieve our thoughts. 

Firstly, there is this general idea that our thoughts are created. 

That we have this ability to consciously think a 'thought'.

Which in other words, means that we can control what we think and when.

Secondly, and perhaps most interestingly, is this idea that our thoughts are virtual.

Which some of us may or may not agree with. 

Regardless, I would say that there's this general understanding in society that thoughts don't exist in a physical sense.

And that they merely serve as a virtual concept in our minds to be tinkered around with. 

For the end goal of rationalisation. 

<!-- For example, we can just as easily destroy a thought, as we can create one.  -->

<!-- Often, without process.  -->

Now. 

Please understand. 

(and this is where most people lose their shit)

That our emotions are no different to our thoughts.

They are both equivalent. 

Much like a thought, emotions can also be created at will.

Much like a thought, they are both completely virtual.

Furthermore, the two are completely interchangable. 

I suppose what makes this information so striking, is that it tends to go against what most people commonly believe about their emotions.

Rather, most people tend to view their emotions as being separate from their thoughts. 

<!-- Now, I'm not expecting you to believe me.

At all.  -->

Certainly, the usual reaction I get from most people is complete and utter rejection. 

Simply because they have a very different model of how their emotions work. 

Instead, most people have this idea that their thoughts have some kind of control over their emotions. 

In the sense that they need a reason or a belief in order to feel something. 

Which is understandable, given that I once used to think like this. 

All I can say in respect to this (at least for now).

Is that by learning and unlearning how the mind works, I can now direct my feelings and emotions without the need for logic or reason. 

Which is to say that I can simply create happiness, by willfully ...creating it.

Put simply, the reason why many of us tend to view this seperation between our thoughts and emotions. 

Is because it's what we've learnt. 

Since birth we've taught ourselves this idea that our emotions cannot be willfully created.

And so it becomes this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Which through repeated experience, seeds itself into a belief. 

And that's what becomes our reality.

A tragic, sufferable reality. 

Now please allow me to explain why that reality is a lie. 

### Understanding Beliefs

![Understanding Beliefs](/img/blog/23-03.png)

Provided my understanding of mental illness.

As well as my understanding of how humans form beliefs. 

(which admittedly, I didn't go into much detail about, however will try to explain in this chapter)

I believe the aim of addressing mental illness is to develop the ability to control our virtual reality. 

And hence, how we interpret reality. 

Nothing more. Nothing less. 

So how does one do that? 

Well, for starters. 

It begs to note that you're already in control of your virtual reality. 

Understandably, you may not be aware of it, nor have the skills to enact on it with your current understanding of mental illness. 

However, this isn't to say that you don't already have the facilities to control what you think, how you feel, as well as what you believe.

And of course, rejection of this understanding forms merely one of the many self-limiting beliefs people have of themselves.

Self-limiting beliefs which result in a state of mental illness for the rest of their lives. 

Because they're too afraid to let go of their fear-based beliefs which trap them within their own mental illness.

For example, the belief that they will always remain mentally ill. 

The belief that there is nothing they can do to change who they are. 

And the list goes on. 

However, there are a few reasons why you are in fact, solely responsible for your own thoughts and emotions.

And to understand why, we need to take a closer look at our language, which is where a lot of our implicit beliefs hide. 

For example, sometimes we can feel frustrated at the actions of another person. 

They do the thing that frustrates us, which creates an emotional reaction.

And then we say in response 'that person really pisses me off'. 

In our language, we attribute the way we feel to their actions. 

(and is also part of the reason why we develop this idea that our emotions must be caused by a reason)

Of course, that's just a lie we tell ourselves.

It's a lie because it completely neglects how we actually create emotion.

In reality, what's actually happened is that their action activated one of our beliefs.

Which says that 'I am going to feel pissed off when they do this thing'.

It's almost as we set ourselves up for failure through our beliefs.

The problem is that we get so caught up in the emotional reaction, that we don't have the awareness to realise the witness the underlying belief. 

It's the reason why mental illness is so predictable. It's merely a pattern we repeat due to what we believe. 

Understandably it's all very subtle, but that's what happens in our brain. 

And it's the sole reason why you're responsible for your own thoughts and emotions. 

Not me. 

Not the actions of the world around you. 

Only you. 

In particular, you and your beliefs. 

And this arguably is the hardest thing for people suffering from mental illness to undesrtand. 

That they are responsible for their beliefs. 

And that others aren't responsible for activating them. 

Which is why many of us continue to suffer in denial.

Because of this idea that we have control over ourselves, perhaps because it's too much for us to bare. 

You see, humans are rational creatures. 

And as a side-effect of this, we don't actually care what reason we come across. 

We just want a reason. 

It could be a reason with a fundamental flaw. It could be complete gibberish. 

Our brain doesn't care. 

It just wants to feel as if it's in control.

Desperation at it's purist. 

### Self-Awareness

![Self-Awareness](/img/blog/23-03.png)

Aside from the way we use our language.

There are many different ways we abdicate our power away through our beliefs. 

Largely, because that's what beliefs do. 

They take our limited willpower and they invest it in an interpretation. 

In other words, by limiting our beliefs and the influence they have over ourselves.

The greater power we can have over the decisions we make, as well as our own interpretation of reality. 

Which really is to say that our beliefs are merely lies.

These personal interpretations that we commit to ourselves, often based in faulty rationalisation, and that merely narrow our point of view. 

After all, beliefs are just another construct of virtual reality, no different to our thoughts and emotions. 

Constructs which can be created and destroyed within an instant. 

Now, does this mean that they're not useful? 

Absolutely not. 

However, with this understanding we can have greater control over what we believe. 

Precisely, by letting go of our beliefs.

And simply being present with ourselves, as an alternative to holding on to these prefabricated interpretations of what reality is. 

Of course, this isn't the approach most people take. 

Instead, most people will recognise a problem, and try and create these kinds of 'counter-beliefs' to reassure themselves.

For example, when someone feels as if they're unworthy or not good enough. 

They'll try to perk themselves up by telling themselves that they're amazing.

Only to end up feeling worse about themselves.

The reason why is because they're still fighting with their underlying beliefs.

Which positive reinforcement does nothing to address. 

A losing battle which merely results in further guilt and shame, making them feel worse about themselves. 

As they battle this self-image which tells them otherwise.

With the foundation of one lie, they try to treat it with another. 

A pointless act at best. 

### Conclusion

![Conclusion](/img/blog/23-05.png)

So that's what's going on in my head.

Precisely, not very much.

I'm slowly hunting and dissolving the beliefs in my mind.

I'm refraining from giving away my willpower to personal interpretation. 

Which I find quite beneficial, provided my lifestyle. 

Rather than worrying or doubting myself, I find myself spending more time doing the things I enjoy. 

I'm feeling positive about my life, and my attitude towards life has changed significantly.

I refrain from judging others (well, at least when I'm self-aware of it), and I keep my mind from wandering off into those narratives of guilt and anger. 

It's definitely helped me avoid a lot of unnecessary emotional reaction.

I've become more forgiving of the past. 

I no longer have a breakdown when I think of my ex.

(which is a huge thing for me)

I even no longer get triggered by sexual images, because I no longer hold onto that personal interpretation in my mind. 

I find myself becoming much more accepting and tolerant of situations which I feel like are out of my control. 

Though of course, there are still a few things that freak me out. 

As well as a few self-limiting beliefs I haven't quite been able to approach, such as the topic of my mother.

However, the way I see it is that if I do a little bit each day. 

Then I'll gradually see improvements overtime. 

And that each second spent being happy is going to have a net-positive effect to my wellbeing. 

As through small agreements we create large. 

Ultimately, the message I want to get across is that mental illness can be conquered. 

And that change is possible. 

Even if that means spending an entire lifetime in hell. 




<!-- Regardless.

I feel happy.

Where to begin. 

Lately I've been feeling incredibly positive about my life. 

I no longer feel straddled in the self-limiting fears and beliefs which held me down. 

Of course, I'm not perfect. 

There are still things I'm afraid of, like spiders - for example. 

However things from my past which used to traumatise me and trigger me.

No longer have that effect on me. 

Again, I'm not perfect and I haven't reclaimed absolutely every single event  in my life. 

However I'm there enough that I feel incontrol, and it's something I work towards and grow each day. 




Unlike physical reality, virtual reality isn't something that's forced upon you.

(at least for a large majority of people with mental illness, unlike something like schizophrenia)

Virtual reality is something you create in your mind. 

Many people reject this idea that we have control over our emotinos 



 to view our emotions as being an integral part of our physical reality. 

We view our emotions as something sacred, something tangible, a source of truth. 

They do not understand that their emotions are not a reflection of physical reality. 

And this is the reason why things like mental illness exists.

So what exactly are the consequences of confusing our virtual reality with our physical reality? 




I'll let you figure that one out on your own.

So.

I had one of those moments.

I'm not exactly sure when it happened, but I think it had a lot to do with my last post.

My last post was quite personal and traumatic for me. 

I personally noticed that I was quite drawn into the story as I writing it. 

As I relived events in mind that happened many years ago.

Events that I continue to relive on a constant basis. 

And as I was writing, something sparked in my mind like a wildfire. 

This notion of empowerment which fundamentally shattered my perception of reality.

I decided at that moment that I was going to focus on my mental health.

Just as I did this same time four years ago. 

To deal with the exact same issues which having been plaguing me since then. 

And my gosh, 




Before I continue it may help to think of these ideas as mere abstractions. 

For example, a thought or an emotion can be viewed as an abstraction. 

They don't exist as a concrete entity. 

Rather, we give them meaning through description aka words. 

It helps in that it  -->
