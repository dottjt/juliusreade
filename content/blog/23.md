Now. 

I don't want to go as far as to say that I'm no longer mentally ill.

As it assumes a guarantee of permanence I cannot clearly prove. 

However, what I would like to say.

Is that I've made some very dramatic changes over the past few weeks. 

And that as a result of those changes, I feel as if become a completely different person.

For example.

I'm smiling a lot more. 

Which wouldn't seem like a big deal, if it weren't for the fact that I'm literally smiling.

All the time.  

It's incredible, and I highly recommend you give it a try too. 

What essentially happened is that I took this mental health course. 

(as part of pathwaytohappiness.com, I would highly recommend checking it out)

And it literally broke me in the best possible way. 

I've now become more self-aware of all my thoughts and emotions. 

And more importantly, I feel as if I'm in control of every single aspect of my mind. 

Now the problem, I imagine.

At least from your point of view, as the reader. 

Is that it appears that I've gone from one extreme to another. 

Which is a fair assessment, and case for my bipolar tendencies. 

On the other hand, please allow me to try and explain. 

Why I haven't died and gone insane. 

### Virtual Reality

![Virtual Reality](/img/blog/23-01.png)

It's hard to know exactly where to start. 

However I think explaining how we become mentally ill, might be a good place to begin our understanding. 

Imagine this concept called the virtual reality.

The virtual reality is this largely conceptual idea, where nothing is real. 

In fact, everything within the virtual reality is fabricated out of our imagination. 

It is something we imagine, although perhaps with inspiration from the real world. 

Regardless, the two are quite different. 

I suppose what makes the virtual reality so spectacular is that it feels real. 

To the point that many of us can no longer tell the difference between physical and imagined reality. 

Now, you may think this premise sounds absurd.

However let's take a closer look at how we integrate this idea of the virtual reality into our lives. 

Take our computer screens, for example. 

Which many of us are dependent upon for our daily function. 

On a flat, 2D surface we can literally experience the world. 

We can view images which take us to places we could never ever dream of possibly visiting. 

We can watch videos based on outlandish, fantasy worlds - with creatures that do not exist in our physical world. 

We can play video games that allow us to do the impossible. 

We can read of accounts that took places hundreds of years ago in public archives. 

In other words, we've become quite efficient at embracing this idea of the virtual reality. 

To the point that we no longer consider it abnormal to have virtual relationships, or even spend most our lives within virtual, online communities.

(take tumblr or facebook, for example)

Now, there are some things we still do find weird. 

Like people getting married to virtual partners, as you can in Japan. 

However, so was online dating at one point - yet now it's considered completely normal. 

Of course, that's just one example of a virtual reality. 

The other virtual reality, and most important virtual reality which most of us do not consider. 

Is the virtual reality of the mind. 

### Understanding Mental Illness

![Understanding Mental Illness](/img/blog/23-02.png)

The good news, and perhaps why we're lucky to be trying to understand mental illness in today's the modern age. 

Is that most of us are already quite familiar with how our virtual realities work. 

Whether we're engaging with a fantasy novel or watching a movie - we've become quite adept at embracing these virtual words. 

Which is better than good news.

It's bloody fantastic news news because it means you're already halfway there to understanding how mental illness functions. 

So, what exactly is the virtual reality of the mind? 

As a broad overview it consists of the imagined (or percieved) experience we have of life.

In more simple terms, it consists of the thoughts and emotions we produce on a daily basis. 

Now there are two very interesting things to note here. 

First, is that thoughts are created. 

Thoughts don't just magically appear out of thin air.

It's something we must think. It is a verb. It is a doing. 

Second, and perhaps most interestingly, thoughts don't actually exist. 

When we create a thought in our mind, it is merely this virtual concept.

Sure, we can describe our thoughts with words and through language, create meaning from them.

However ideas are not concrete objects - they merely form part of our perception of reality.

As do our thoughts and emotions.

Yes. 

What this essentially means is that our emotions are no different to our thoughts.

Much like our thoughts, our emotions are merely virtual constructs we create and describe.

Yet where a lot of people diverge, is that they do not view their emotions in the same way that they view their thoughts.

They instead, view their emotions as being an integral part of their physical reality. 

They view their emotions as something sacred, something tangible, a source of truth. 

And sure, that's what they're designed to do. 

However that's not also not to say that they aren't virtual. 

They do not understand that their emotions are merely virtual, and that we can create or let go of them at our own disgression. 

They do not understand that their emotions are not a reflection of physical reality. 

And this is the reason why things like mental illness exists.

So what exactly are the consequences of confusing our virtual reality with our physical reality? 

I'll let you figure that one out on your own. 

### Managing Our Virtual Reality

Now, the aim of addressing mental illness is quite clear. 

In essence, it is about maintaining the ability to have control over our virtual reality. 

Nothing more.

Nothing less. 

Now you may be asking, is it even possible to control something that is so tightly entwined with our perception of the world? 

I mean, if a person is struggling to distinguish the difference between the two.

Where do you even begin? 

Well, before I explain how to achieve this 




Well. (and here's where it blows most people's minds) 

You already are incontrol of your virtual reality. 

Wait, what? 

The reason why you're in control of your reality is because you're solely responsible for creating it. 

You not realise it, however you 

Unlike physical reality, virtual reality isn't something that's forced upon you.

(at least for a large majority of people with mental illness, unlike something like schizophrenia)

Virtual reality is something you create in your mind. 

Many people reject this idea that we have control over our emotinos

### The visit

I suppose the message I want to get across is that mental illness isn't as complex as it seems. 

It just seems complex when we're trapped within our own little fantasy. 


I no longer feel straddled in the self-limiting fears and beliefs which held me down. 

Of course, I'm not perfect. 

There are still things I'm afraid of, like spiders - for example. 

However things from my past which used to traumatise me and trigger me.

No longer have that effect on me. 

Again, I'm not perfect and I haven't reclaimed absolutely every single event  in my life. 

However I'm there enough that I feel incontrol, and it's something I work towards and grow each day. 


I feel happy.

Where to begin. 

Lately I've been feeling incredibly positive about my life. 









I feel like it had something to do with the last article I wrote. 

<!-- 


So.

I had one of those moments.

I'm not exactly sure when it happened, but I think it had a lot to do with my last post.

My last post was quite personal and traumatic for me. 

I personally noticed that I was quite drawn into the story as I writing it. 

As I relived events in mind that happened many years ago.

Events that I continue to relive on a constant basis. 

And as I was writing, something sparked in my mind like a wildfire. 

This notion of empowerment which fundamentally shattered my perception of reality.

I decided at that moment that I was going to focus on my mental health.

Just as I did this same time four years ago. 

To deal with the exact same issues which having been plaguing me since then. 

And my gosh, 




Before I continue it may help to think of these ideas as mere abstractions. 

For example, a thought or an emotion can be viewed as an abstraction. 

They don't exist as a concrete entity. 

Rather, we give them meaning through description aka words. 

It helps in that it  -->
