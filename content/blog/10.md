Perspective doesn't work. Verifiable systems do

-->

Maybe you're a struggle sport. 

An undefined blob of human failure, awaiting your death in a slurry of shame and complete unanticipation. 

Well look, I'm sure it could be worse.

Because it certainly is much worse, you eclectic piece of crap, as you barely cope with the hours of self-agony you currently recognise as living-consciousness. 

As a certified angel of truth and arbiter of all things righteous:

I'm bloody here to help. 

One of the major reasons why people struggle with success is that they fail to address the basics. 

The fundamentals, so-to-speak.

They spend all this time and energy aimlessly toiling away, without any amount of clarity or certainty, and they exhaust themselves into a coma. 

Yet they stand no closer to who they want to be. 

Instead, they end up cynical and without hope; a rather sad place to be.

No more. 

What we truly crave in these situations is a model for success, which is easily producible and can be widely applied to anything in life. 

In other words, a framework for success.

Quite simple, because they work. 

And you know, I hear that you want to work too, so let's make your fledgingly dreams and desires into a miserable reality. 

### A Model For Success

I'm going to let you in on a secret. 

In fact, it's not really a secret, because you're not stupid and you know exactly what you have to do to become successful. 

You just don't do it. 

And that's what we have to address. 

The funny thing is that while you know what this secret is, that isn't to say that you're aware of what it is. 

So rather than tell you, I'm going to describe this secret in full detail so that by the end of this article, something might click in that mind of yours and you'll do just as your ambitions intended. 

Before then however, let's try and bulid our framework or model for success, starting with the most important question.

What is success?

Well, the answer is quite a simple answer: 

**Success is a verifiable system.** 

Nothing more. Nothing less. 

To elaborate, success is a system of structured processes that enable you to work towards your goals and ambitions to the best of your ability. 

While systems are usually quite complex, they are ultimately comprised of processes and structures.

In more simple terms, this can be broken down into work and routine. 

Time and effort. Call it what you will. 

In the case of aspiring programmers, their processes are to study and learn code, while their structure is in a set of routines that dictate how and when they study. 

What makes systems so brilliant is that they're verifiable.

This ultimately means that if you do what's required, you will obtain your goals.  

They work because you can verify your progress based on how well you've committed to the system. 

The system they utilise to train soldiers works.  

The problem most people face is that they fail to utilise or discover a system that works for them. 

Either they lose motivation too quickly, struggle to learn or  

But wait!

Did I say earlier that are systems veriable? 

Well yes, they do - if you continue reading.

The only issue is that the so-called 'systems' attempted weren't verifiable . 

The problem is that instead of treating success as a system, we instead treat it as this unknown foreign object. 

### We Don't Want The System To Work

Humans have a habit of dysfunctioning. 

We lie to ourselves. We deluded ourselves. We needlessly throw away opportunities - we falther. 

because a fact you have not yet accepted, because you're too distracted to truly want success. 





 goal You need to put your goals before yourself. Make it work; // We need to change the way we think. We need to stop seeing our limitations and exploring making it work. When you have a goal, an aim, your purpose is to do everything you can in your power. You must change your language. The problem is that the goal doesn’t really care about you. The goal doesn’t care about your bad decisions. It doesn’t care about how you feel. It is like a selfish baby that demands you attention. The process is rewarding. 





Let me tell you about the absolute secret about success that people rarely talk about:
