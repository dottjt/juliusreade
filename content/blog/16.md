<!-- 
Mental Illness Has Always Been A Problem Of Emotion
Your emotions are an elaborate lie. 

-->

Mental illness has always been a problem of emotion.

We either feel too much, too little, or not at all.

As a result, many of us end up losing context of our emotions and falling into the wonderful world of mental illness. 

A glorious realm where nothing makes sense, and making poor, somewhat regretable decisions seems so damn right. 

Obviously, there are many different ways we can end up losing context of our emotions.

Our emotions can encapsulate us to the point that we no longer feel like functioning as responsible, productive adults. 

Instead, living in a kind of volatile, caustic bubble dictated by reaction and insecurity. 

In other cases, people can feel so little that they no longer know how to feel.

Turning into gullible, easily persuaded guinea pigs, as they chase trends in a desperate attempt to feel anything at all. 

Regardless, when you lose context of your emotions, you lose your ability to control yourself and act within your best intentions. 

In fact, when you think about it on a very basic level, life is nothing more than a game of managing emotion.

In order to achieve and create change... or not. 

In a sense, that's why I believe it's possible to prevent burnout from excessive effort. 

If you can feel the right amount of emotion and sustain that, while also maintaining your drive, then you can just about achieve anything.

(Obviously it's not easy, but we're not here to do easy.)

Often the simpliest way to know when we've lost context of our emotions is if we feel unable to change how we feel.

Which often takes place in moments of intense hatred or sadness.

Where we feel so utterly convinced that what we're feeling is permanent.

Causing us to no longer question our actions. 

"Yes, eating an entire block of chocolate was totally the right thing to do."

Certainly, part of what makes these emotional reactions feel so real is in how they can suddenly overtake us. 

As if ignited by a spark, engulfing us in flames. 

In reality, these emotions don't just appear out of nowhere. 

They're constructed over a number of smaller agreements that we gradually create into a gargantuan, complex agreement.

An agreement so complex and insane, that it makes us feel trapped within our emotinos. 

In part, because the complexity makes us feel clueless as to how we can dismantle the hundreds of smaller agreements that all reinforce each other.

It's often why it's too late to control our emotions once we have an episode. 

Because the stage has been set, and you've been cast as the crazy, old white man with shotgun. 

While there are many ways we can approach this hivemind of complexity, today I want to start simple.

I want to explain what emotions are, as well as why they're not so scary. 

In other words, to provide you with context as to what your emotions actually are.

So you don't feel so silly or hopeless the next time you find yourself "triggered". 

And it all begins with a simple analogy.

### Emotions Are Like Traffic Lights

![Emotions Are Like Traffic Lights](/img/blog/16-01.png)

I really like this analogy.

Mostly because I came up with it, but hopefully it clicks with you too. 

I promise it'll be more infectuous than the chlamydia currently growing inside you.  

Ultimately, emotions can be thought of as traffic lights. 

Traffic lights, for the unaccquianted, are those red and green lights you see at intersections, which tell cars whether they can turn or move forward.

Ingenious. I know, right? 

Though when was the last time you actually sat down to think about traffic lights?

Probably never. 

Even if so, it probably isn't something you consciously and frequently think about (unless if it's part of your work, or is an actual hobby of yours).

In fact, no one really thinks about traffic lights all that much. 

They're simply there. At the intersection. Doing their thing. 

And that's that. 

The reason being that you have this intrisic understanding in your mind that they'll simply work.

No different to the electricity flowing through the city or the water running through the pipes.

And in most cases, they usually do. 

So rather than think about traffic lights, you're probably thinking about someone you have a massive crush on, or some deep and meaningful topic like post-modern existentialism. 

In your mind, this is how life is supposed to be - and that's perfectly fine. 

I mean, I would largely agree. 

Yet what happens when the power goes out and the traffic lights stop working?

Well, if you're driving on the road, you'll probably start taking notice of the cars around you. 

And when you reach an intersection, you'll realise that the traffic lights aren't working. 

Instead, you realise that you're going to have to think for yourself, and take things more cautiously. 

Now most people will continue to drive, in the process communicating with other drivers, in the hope of getting to where they need to be. 

Even though they realise they're in a pickle, they also understand that it's important to safely get to their destination. 

So rather than freak out and decide not to drive at all, they instead understand that by taking things slow and being cautious, they have nothing to worry about, no matter how tough it may be. 

The fact is, they're prepared.

However these are not all drivers. 

There are some who shut down, who feel afraid, who feel unprepared - and who choose not to drive to get to where they need to.

These people are us.

### Sending The Wrong Signals

![Sending The Wrong Signals](/img/blog/16-02.png)

If we compare our emotions to traffic lights, then there really are two states our traffic lights can be in.

Much like the example above, they can be powered off. Comparable to feeling too little at all. 

Alternatively, they can be malfunctioning. Comparable to feeling way, way too much.  

Often, a lot of us tend to fluctuate between the two. 

When the traffic lights are off and not working, it makes us feel confused and helpless. 

We don't know what to do, because our emotions aren't indicating what we should be doing. 

It is what makes us feel empty and alone, in our lack of motivation and general will to live.

On the contrary when we are feeling too much, too much sadness or too much anger (and even happiness can lead to delusion).

Our traffic lights can malfunction and send us mixed signals, telling us to go forward when we shouldn't, or turn into incoming traffic. 

In essence, our traffic lights are fucked. 

The shitty people and shitty thoughts in our life have tinkered with the circuitry - and now nothing is working as it should. 

That's where we stand, however let's talk solutions. 

The reason why I like comparing our emotions to traffic lights, is that when you think about it, they cannot necessarily preventing us from moving forward.

Sure, they may be telling us not to move forward - however that doesn't mean that we can't just put our foot down and zoom ahead.

Now arguably this can be a poor idea, especially if the traffic lights are working as intended.

However in times of a crisis, we must learn to think for ourselves and understand when we can or cannot ignore our traffic lights.  

It's only because we put faith into the traffic lights that we feel unable to change. 

In reality, they're merely providing us with cues for what we should do. 

Rather than control the car that is us. 

Now obviously it's scary questioning the traffic lights, especially when we may have relied on them for so long. 

However learning not to take them personally, and understanding that they are external to our ability to change and have no actual authority is one half of the battle.

Being able to actually do that is the other half. 

### Reinterpreting Our Emotions

![Reinterpreting Our Emotions](/img/blog/16-03.png)

Learning to externalise our emotions is a good place to start. 

However it is also important to understand why our emotions are important, and how we can embrace them within the process.

Ultimately, our aim is to achieve a balance so that we don't feel too little or too much. 




Although they can cause us suffering, our emotions 

We use our emotions to know when it's okay to feel safe, when we should be afraid, when we should feel guilt, amongst a whole range of other feelings. 



The good news is that our emotions ultimately change 


Ultimately the aim 




We use our emotions to know when it's okay to feel safe, when we should be afraid, when we should feel guilt, amongst a whole range of other feelings.

And when our emotions stop sending us the right signals, we can actually begin to think that there's something wrong with us.  

Taking it personally and downing three bottles of wine to dampen the mood. 

Classy. 

Ultimately, emotions can be thought of as specialised indicators. 

Much like traffic lights, they're designed to guide us towards making the "right" decision. 

"Feeling sad? I know, I'll adopt an optimistic attitude and refrain from pursuing my addictions, because it will make me feel worse later"

The problem is that a lot of us didn't learn how to make that right decision.

Instead, the narrative went a little more like: "Feeling sad? Well maybe if I starve myself and get really skinny, I'll like, feel better about myself?".

Through our own interpretation of our emotions, we began reinterpreting the meaning of those green and red lights, beyond which they were originally intended. 

This is the human curse. 

To take reality so personally that we no longer become human anymore. 

I suppose the big difference between driving a car through a set of broken traffic lights, and the conscious human mind.

Is that the immediate urgency or danger of neglecting our emotions does't become apparent until much later. 

We don't necessarily risk death when we ignore our emotions or proceed with a pessimistic mindset.

Often, the feedback is small if not neglible - unlike winding your body around a tree at 100km/ph due to your vague drowziness. 

The issue is that these problems or reinterpretations arise over time, as we slowly reinforce these behaviours into our mind. 

It's never the first time you told yourself you're worthless. It's the 20,000th time that finally puts the nail in the coffin. 

Ultimately, it's the idea that through small agreements, we create large. 

### Seeing Through The Red And Green Illusion

![Seeing Through The Red And Green Illusion](/img/blog/16-04.png)

The beautiful thing about our emotions is that they're merely indicators.

Which is to say that they're nothing more than a simple feeling, until we provide it with context. 

It's funny how context can dramatically change the meaning of what we're interpreting. 

If we believe someone is innocent then we can let them get away with anything, however if we believe they're conspiring against us, then we ensure that they feel hell. 

Because the truth is, meaning and value are created through our own beliefs and interpretations of reality.

In the overall scheme of things, this provides us with two options moving forward:

We can either detach our emotions from our beliefs and expose them for what they are - indicators.

Alternatively, we can change our interpretations so that they no longer provide our emotions with meaning. 

In other words, to no longer take our emotions personally, or to change how we feel about them. 

The first angle provides us with immediate results, while the second method provides us with long-term results. 

Both are nearly impossible.

Which is why there's a third option.

Rather than trying to work with our emotions, we can stop listening to our emotions altogether.

While this sounds quite radical, in practice it promotes basic self-awareness. 

Rather than listen to your emotions, you instead observe your emotional state and refrain from getting involved.

It works because it keeps you out of the fight. It allows you to truly see yourself for what you are. 

To assist this, I often find it helps to imagine yourself stepping away from your body, as if you're watching yourself from a 3rd person point of view.

Because trying to communicate with malfunctioning traffic lights doesn't help. They don't actually care about you or have your best interest in mind. 

They don't even realise you're there.

They're simply malfunctioning in their own world. 

Which is why you need to get out, once you 


### Don't Think And Rationalise

![Don't Think And Rationalise](/img/blog/16-05.png)

Unlike traffic lights, our emotions are reinforced by good behaviour. 

The better you behave, the better our emotions will function.

On the otherhand, trying to talk to yourself out of your emotions, at least I find, doesn't help. 

Because you end up engaging with yourself from a 1st person point of view, which merely solidifies what you're feeling. 

Thinking your way out of your emotions also usually doesn't help.

The problem is that the act of thinking engages with your beliefs which merely reinforces and makes you more attached to your emotions.

Observation on the other hand is designed to detach yourself. 

Another aspect to consider is how we can best gauge reality.

If not for our emotions, then what? 

When traffic lights go down, we still have other references to navigate through reality, such as our vision. 

Which is no different to when our emotions go haywire. 

This is similar with when we lose sense of our emotions. 

I suppose this explains the idea behind not taking things personally.

To take something personally, is ultimately to provide your emotions with power and to legitimise them. 

Which really is to treat the broken traffic light before us as a source of truth. 

Also known quite suitably as delusion.

I know it's gonna sound lame, di

I don't think there's an easy way to overcome delusion, however 





And it's no wonder, because emotion is a very powerful thing. 

It's the number one tool we use to gain trust and respect, as well as to convey our intentions. 

Though I'm sure you already know this. 




<!--

They're certainly more cautious and they're communicating with other drivers and giving way, however little has changed for them.


Humans are emotional creatures. 



Which means the best way to gain trust is by 



Not that change is easy, which is why most people end up staying in their abusive relationships indefinitely. 

On other side of the coin are people who have remained stationary for so long that they no longer know how to drive.

Which is to say that even inlieu of functioning traffic lights, still would be unable to get to where they want to be. 

Largely relating to people who feel too little at all. 

The worst part is that it's self-reinforcing.

Most people don't even realise they're doing it, and it often reaches a point where they think this is actually who they are - nothing. 

Which is how people end up with a BMI of 800 or develop an incredibly judgemental attitude - these outcomes are reinforced over decades, one thought at a time.

The other consequence of this slow trickle, this gradual build up, is it makes us oblivious to how we got there in the first place.

Because we don't take notice to how we got there. We simply become triggered and it encapsulates us to the point of no return. 

Of course, I can't imagine thinking ourselves out of this situation is going to be of much help. 

Which is why we need a few tricks to snap ourselves out of it.
