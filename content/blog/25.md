Compassion isn't hard. It's merely forgotten. 

Humans naturally tend towards compassion, so there's nothing really to learn here.

The issue is that this concept of compasssion simply isn't something we  consciously keep in our minds. 

Amongst the stress, responsibility and self-obsession - we forget that we don't have to focus on the guilt, shame and emotion we feel on a daily basis.

We forget that life is inherently simple, and that we merely overcomplicate things to manage the daily complexity of life. 

So this is today's reminder to be compassionate.

To be human. 

In particular, I want to explore why you should be compassionate towards yourself - the person you hate most. 

Because rather than treat ourselves right, a lot of us tend to consciously tolerate our own suffering - simply because we forget that we can be compassionate instead.

And I certainly don't blame people. 

This is human priority playing out in excess, along with the modern pressures of society. 

There are a lot of reasons why we fail to be compassionate.

A large part of the reason, I think, is because our mind is elsewhere. 

It's sort of like when you accidentally happen to think about someone from high school for the first time ever.

It's like "Holy shit, I forgot that person even existed!"

Well, hopefully I can give you your holy shit moment today. 

The idea is that we want to start consciously thinking about compassion.

So that it can become a central part of our lives, even more so than our own focus and determination. 

And when I rediscovered compassion again recently, it was pretty incredible. 

Certainly, I'd become so detached from reality, that when I read about these concept of compassion for the first time in years, it managed to blow a few circuits in my mind. 

In particular, self-compassion. 

Because this ain't about others. 

This is about learning to love yourself, and embracing that to become even more effective as a human being. 

### Why Is Compassion So Hard? 

![Why Is Compassion So Hard?](/img/blog/17-01.png)

Compassion is the sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others.

In other words, to have a healthy consideration for those in lesser positions.

In other words, yourself. 

The thing I love about compassion is that it doesn't ask or require anything of you. 

It's completely free.

All it says is, "things are tough, and you should go love yourself".

It applies when things suck. It applies when things are great. 

What's not to like about it? 

Well, at the same time I also admit that compassion is somewhat of a luxury.

As silly as it sounds, compassion is something that a lot of us simply cannot afford.

We have a million other pressing issues in our mind, racing past our ability to even consciously comprehend them, that this idea of compassion.

I mean, we can still be nice people - howeer it becomes more of a response to the responsibility we hold towards society, rather than a conscious effort to connect with ourselves and others. 

It's probably also the reason why most people don't change - they can never quite catch up with the race in their minds. 

What can help is to think of compassion as a kind of guide. 

A simple philosophy that keep in your mind, 

I mean, when doesn't it make sense not to love yourself? Is there ever a situation where love is bad? 

The hard part this all is that a lot us weren't taught to think this way about ourselves growing up.

Usually through harsh criticism and judgement, we instead learn that self-criticism was the way to go. 

Which isn't to say that we don't love ourselves, however it slowly warps us over time to forget that we even have the ability to love ourselves at all. 

This probably emphasises the importance of balance, so that we don't entirely lose ourselves within our conquests. 

Managing information and human complexity has always been one of the hardest problems for us to deal with, and inevitably concepts such as compassion are going to be lost along the way. 


Compassion is a product of who we are, no different to how we are a product of society. 

As a product, exposure is essential. 


### Compassion Is A Product.  

![Why Is Compassion So Hard?](/img/blog/17-02.png)

A more fundamental question we need to ask is why we forget to be compassionate. 

I think the answer is quite simple. 

Firstly, I think compassion is a state of mind. 

Secondly, our daily interactions aren't centered around facilitating love.

And through slow attrition, we change the way we think away from being compassionate.

Instead, we're focused on the result. 

The funny thing about compassion is that it isn't difficult. 

There's nothing about compassion that doesn't make sense. 

It's literally something that just clicks in your mind. 

Yet what makes compassion so difficult is that it's an entirely foregin concept in modern society. 

We are not taught to be compassionate, and most companies view compassion as a form of weakness.

Instead, we are taught about responsibility and blame. 

Competition doesn't breed compassion. 

It's do or die - and that is something you drill into yourself. 





### Compassion Is A Product.  

![Why Is Compassion So Hard?](/img/blog/17-03.png)

Admittedly, I'm not a very compassionate person.

I'm not sure if I ever used to be, however it's something that I can tell has gotten worse over the years. 

In pursuing my goals, I taught myself to detach from the people around me.

I mean, it wasn't perfect, but I viewed it as a necessary evil more than anything. 

In my mind I felt it was the only way to get anything done, which made complete sense at the time. 

Put simply, I was surrounded by shitheads. 

People who did nothing to contribute towards my mental health. 

And this was my way of dealing with that. 

I suppose the problem is that even though those circumstances have changed and I've managed to leave all these people behind.

My attitude towards life is still stuck in hostility. 

I still rely on this hatred to protect myself, and that is something I want to change.

Given my awareness of the situation. 

Okay, the intro isn't too great, but I promise there's a lot to learn from this one. 


I suppose the problem is that compassion is many different things.







Yet for whatever reason,  compassion is difficult.


What makes it difficult is the society 



I suppose what makes it hard is that it's just a foreign concept in modern society. 








We don't live in a compassionate society. 

In my head I'm stuck in this world of diminishing promises and brutal competition, and believe part of my humanity died along with it. 

Certainly, even though I knew something wasn't right with me, I merely thought it was a necessary burden in my pursuit for productivity. 

Part of the consequence of this attitude is that I developed resentment towards others, rather than undesrtanding.

I merely focused on my own point of view and how I was benefiting, which although valid - provided nothing for my mental health. 




### Self-Compassion. Holy Shit.

One thing that can help is to view ourselves as being no different between you and me. 




### Breaking The Us Vs Them Mentality.

People make awful logicians.

One of the biggest logical fallacies we make, and one that has very significant consequences, is this idea that arguments are one dimensional. 

For example, we believe either that someone either hates us or likes us. 

Yet we don't think in the possibility that maybe it's because we hate or like ourselves.
