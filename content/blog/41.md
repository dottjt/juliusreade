### Understanding Our Lack Of Process

Bipolar disorder and how to cheat it.

I'm pretty sure I have some form of bipolar. 

Manic. Hyper. Disassociation. 

Call it a dreamer's disease. 

It's a keen trait of the budding entrepeneur. 

It's not a sad s

I suppose I want to detail what it actually means to have bipolar, as well as how to manage it.

The good news is that I totally get I'm bipolar and it's not... I don't think it's quite a bad disorder to have.

Rather, I think it's a side-effect - rather than some kind of 

The other good news is that I'm aware of the cycle it takes me through ... at least as much as I can be.

Which is to say that although I cannot avoid the ups and downs, there is a clear path in the sense that there is always resolution.

I'm a workaholic.

I'm not exactly sure why.

However I suspect everyone is a workaholic to some degree.

You see, work isn't about labour or employment.

Work is about obsession.

When you're obsessed with something, you work towards that reality.

And you'll do absolutely everything in your power to make it 'work' for you.

When you work you effectively build your own reality.

This is often why it can be negative to remain within toxic environments.

Because it reinforces your work ethic, which dictates every single aspect of how you view the world. 

Therefore I would say that it's quite important to choose what you work towards.

With the full understanding that it is shaping who you are, almost without question. 

You see, I'm delusional. 

And very insecure. 

Which is why a lot of my time is spent creating business systems.
