Everyone's an addict.



I say this because every single one of us is receptive to dopamine.

It's just that some of us are less addicted than others. 

Most typical people we call 'addicts' are usually addicted several times a day, whether it be through cravings or through the general thought of pursuing their addiction. 

The 'non-addicts' on the other hand are the ones who are usually unconsciously triggered once a week, once a month perhaps. 

The non-addicts are the minority in society who actually have their shit together. I approximate 5% based on the people I know.

People who are focused and who aren't distracted by food, drugs or your predetermined vice of the day. 

The other reason why we're all addicts to some degree is quite simple: 

Every single one of us is part of this awful, dwindling arrangement called society.

And it's impossible to escape the dopamine-wielding influences around us, especially given the compound of dopamine is biologically necessary. 

Are there people in society who are balanced? 

Of course, however they are a very, very rare breed.

And I'm being generous. 

Funnily enough, most people are not aware of their addictions. 

They don't realise that their being overweight or unambitious is a product of their addiction.

Which in part is due to the standards which society upholds - a society which has normalised sugar and soft drink.

Not merely as an option, however as a default choice. 

Enough about that however. 

I'm here to talk about how you can overcome addiction, or at the very least aim to normalise your cravings. 

I've found a method that largely works - at least thus far, at the inexperienced age of 24. 

A method that allows you to control your cravings, and get on with life.

It's actually quite easy. 

### Why We Fail To Control Our Cravings

![Addiction Isn't Complicated](/img/blog/15-01.png)

The interesting thing about knowledge is that it's useless if it's not complete. 

You can know 95% of how something works, however without that last 5%, those nasty edge-cases can really screw you over. 

I believe the reason why most people struggle with their addictions, is due to not knowing that 5%. 

They know all the things that trigger them, even what they should do when they have an urge - yet they can't quite seem to make it work. 

Well, the reason I'm writing this article is because I believe I've discovered that last 5%, or at least close to. 

And I can happily say that I felt like such an idiot once I discovered it. 

The one that can't be helped is the fact that we often learn by chance. 

Maybe that's simply what it means to grow up. 

Let me start by saying that humans severely overcomplicate addiction. 

We overcomplicate it with our doubts about recovery and with our rationalisations of what we should do.

It interferes with our ability to think, as well as act in our best intention. 

Though perhaps that's the doubt speaking? 

Ultimately, the reason why we overcomplicate things is because we're clueless.

Which is to say that we don't quite know what the outcome of our actions will be, because we don't actually know what to do. 

You see, doubt and action are two sides of the same coin.

If you have enough understanding of your actions, then it overcomes any amount of faith you have in your doubt. 

Though you probably already know that. 

I suppose what I mean to say is that even though we have a general idea of what we should do, most of us simply have difficulty making it work. 

It's almost like being aware of the fact that we're not actually aware. 

I like to make the comparison to meditation.

We all know meditation is about focus and  emptying all our thoughts. 

But to actually do it, consistently, every single time isn't quite so simple.

Knowing how to actually do something is that last 5%.

So today, I am going to explain exactly how to stop your urges from getting the best of you. 

It works not because it's particularly special, however because it helps gap that last 5% you're likely missing.

Of course, I'll try and provide some background context - however in my particular case, it was this tiny, little thing I wasn't doing correctly which caused me to spin out of control. 

Again, it made me feel very stupid once I'd figured out why. 

Though we all have our particular weak points. 

### It's How You Prepare Yourself

![It's How You Prepare Yourself](/img/blog/15-02.png)

Luckily for you, I have a method. 

There are two reasons why it works.

The first reason is because it does, and the second reason is because you'll understand why it works - in detail.

Oh, how dandy. 

The idea is to prevent you from being clueless when your cravings strike.

Not only by eliminating your doubts, however also by providing you with the knowledge to know exactly what you're doing and what the outcome will be.

Exactly. 

Which is to say that you will be prepared. 

Now, there are a lot of different reasons why this particular method works, however I've also come to understand that these reasons are less relevant than the method itself. 

The reason being that understanding why it works won't necessarily assist you in being able to do it. 

I suppose the point I'm make is that your ability to practice and take action, is far more important than your ability to understand what you're doing. 

And regardless of what you think, are two seperate, and very different skills. 

Which dickhead intellectuals like myself haphazardly dismiss, especially when reading some article over the internet.

I've also come to realise it's a truth most of us discover the hard way. 

This article explains it a little better. 

<div class="cross-post-template">
    <a class="cross-post-template-title" href="https://juliusreade.com/2017/03/31/success-is-a-verifiable-system/">Success Is A Verifiable System</a>
</div>

When you master the method, you no longer need to think or worry, because it handles those aspects for you.

Which really is to say that we like to spend more time thinking and worrying, rather than actually doing what is necessary.

You know, overcomplicate. 

It's a lot like why routine and discipline are so effective.

They handle your emotions and your expectations for you. 

So all you need to do on your behalf is to commit and actually do the thing.

The funny thing about this kind of logic however, is that it everything only makes sense once you actually commit. 

Again, most people need to learn the hard way.

Don't blame me, I already explained to you in plain words why it's important. 

Though thankfully, this method doesn't require a lot of faith or commitment.

Because unlike a marriage, you know exactly what the outcome will be.

Which is also to say that it can be effortless. 

### Short-Term Plan. Long-Term Plan. 

![Short-Term Plan. Long-Term Plan.](/img/blog/15-03.png)

So what exactly is the best way to be prepared?

Well, to create a plan of course! 

Very broadly speaking, in order to control our cravings (as well as our general addiction) what we are going to do is plan ahead. 

There are two very basic aspects to this:

There are our long-term plans and our short-term plans. 

Our long-term plans are designed to provide us with future ambition and hope. 

Essentially they are designed to provide us with reasons why we shouldn't be addicted in the first place. 

They work because hope is a very, very compelling force. 

What I tend to find is that this is an area most people have down pat. 

It usually takes a very ambitious person to want to tackle their problems, which means they likely have a few of them sorted out - such as their career or their love life. 

Usually how they fail is with their coping mechanisms, or as we'll refer to: Short-term plans. 

Our short-term plans comprise of the individual decisions we make in our head.

Like a clock ticking in the background, these decisions dictate our every move. 

The very things our cravings and addiction influences. 

The problem with our long-term plans is that they are usually inadequate to prevent us from pursuing our urges. 

In a sense, because they don't address what is happening right now - only what is happening gradually 5 years from now. 

Personally, this guide doesn't do much to address our long-term ambitions. 

Again, I assume that if you're reading this article, you probably already have that down pat.

Not to mention, most people tend to struggle with their urges, more than their ability to create hope. 

It's the reason why a lot of people can abstain for a long period of time from their addiction, only to eventually give in. 

Well, our short-term plans can help us with that. 

### How To Control Your Urges

![How To Control Your Urges](/img/blog/15-04.png)

What exactly is a short-term plan? 

Well, it's much shorter than you think. 

Ultimately, it can help to think of it as a form of self-awareness. 

Some people like to think of it as a thought, or an agreement they make in their mind. 

Now obviously there are a lot of different aspects to abstaining from addiction and preventing cravings. 

Prevention is obviously the most important.

Now commonly whenever 

Now whenever you have a craving 





Basically, it's a plan on a very minute scale. 











This idea of pathways is really cool and I'm something I'm incredibly excited to share with you today.

A pathway is like a framework of choice. 

Rather than view our decisions individually, a pathway essentially maps out the outcomes of the individual choices we make, so that we don't have to bother ourselves with the small details. 

And when you no longer have to worry about the small things, you no longer have doubt or anxiety in what you're doing or why. 

Because you already know why. You already know what the outcome is, and it's incredibly empowering. 



The main issue pathways addresses is our lack foresight into how our actions affect our future.

It's the reason we get discouraged during uni. It's the reason we give up halfway into our pursuit for success.

It's because we don't know how our effort is contributing towards our goal.

In the beginning, you're going to want to be quite specific with what you want to achieve.

You have to tell yourself that in three months time, you expect to be 




Why it's always hard starting out

- expectations 
- confusion



The thing I love about pathways is that it can be incredibly vague, as long as you know you're heading in the right direction. 

In my particular case, I'm obsessed with programming and I want to become a professional programmer.

I know that all I have to do is spend at least four hours each day programming, and within the next three years I will have the skills to become a professional programmer. 

End of story. 

Of course, for you it will be much different, because this is the end-goal narrative you create once you do develop the passion and discipline for what you want to achieve.

In the beginning  




I don't worry about what I'm learning. 


Of course, my narrative is actually a lot simplier than that:

I know that if I spend all my free-time learning and that I try my best at everything, I do I will eventually get ahead and achieve my goals. 

The beautiful thing about having something so simple is that it a

There is nothing more to ask.

Something that actually works, not necessarily because of the method, but because it's something you have a strong understanding of.

Which is more important than having all the tools and resources in the world. 

You see, the reason why we overcomplicate addiction isn't because it's complicated.
