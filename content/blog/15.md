    The Unforunate Layman's Guide To Addiction
    How I easily manage addiciton. 
    How I Mostly Overcome Triggers
 -->

Addiction is somewhat of an irreparable subject. 

It's not something we can necessarily fix, nor assume will go away like the ending of a bad dream.

I mean, that's not to say it's impossible to overcome addiction. 

It's just that for most people, addiction is a way of life.

This complex state of mind that embraces us with our every thought, that comes and goes with the seasons. 

And for most people, that's okay. 

I suppose the very definition of an addict is someone who doesn't learn from their mistakes.

Who either consciously or unconsciously pursues the same pattern again, and again, and again. 

Not because they are incapable, but because they're not truly decided on who they are or want to be. 

They don't quite know what they want, because they don't have the courage to understand what they need. 

And it's in this sense that everyone's an addict. 

Because we're cowards. 

As long as every single one of us is receptive to dopamine, addiction will always be a battle to be fought daily.

Most typical 'addicts' will pursue their addiction several times a day, whether it be through the general thought of craving, or through the tantamount pressure crushing their ability to remain focused. 

Non-addicts on the other hand are no better - they just don't quite know it yet.

Ideally situated are recovered addicts - the battlehardened minority who understand what they need. 

These are the kinds of people who are focused and who aren't distracted by food, drugs or your predetermined vice of the week. 

They know how to manage their problems, and avoid their cake too. Who are indeterminably immune from their own scars. 

While addiction is obviously both a physical and mental state of mind, a strong part of it is also cultural.

Every single one of us is part of this awful, dwindling arrangement called society.

Which means it's essentially impossible to escape the dopamine-wielding influences around us, from the advertisements to the beliefs of society coluding in our head.

Telling us to be pursue something we're not - a craving beyond our own senses. 

The other aspect is the standard society sets for us. 

Most people are unaware that their being overweight or unambitious is a product of their addiction.

Because society has normalised these things (along with consumption) as a means to an end. 

Not merely as an option, however as a default choice. 

And unfortunately for most people, it's a choice that's grabbed them left-right-and-centre. 

So today I want to address the heart of the problem. 

To ensure that you stop being addicted. 

Which of course, begins with a simple method. 

### Why We Fail To Control Our Cravings

![Addiction Isn't Complicated](/img/blog/15-01.png)

The interesting thing about knowledge is that it's largely useless if it's incomplete. 

You can know 95% of how something works, like how to perform 95% of heart surgery. 

However without that last 5%, those nasty edge-cases can really screw you over. 

I believe the reason why most people struggle with their addictions is due to not being aware of that last 5%. 

They know all the things that trigger them, even what they should do when they have an urge - yet they can't quite seem to make it work. 

The aim of this article is to help you find that 5%, or at least close to, so you can make progress with your addiction. 

Because I recently discovered my last 5%.

And I can happily say that it made a fool out of me. 

I suppose the takeaway from this is that humans often learn by chance, and that I got very lucky. 

Of course, you won't necessarily need to. Now that I'm sharing what I learnt today in this article. 

Let me start by saying that humans severely overcomplicate addiction. 

We overcomplicate it with our doubts about our potential to recover, and with our rationalisations of how we should aproach it.

It interferes with our ability to think, as well as our ability to act with our best intentions in mind. 

Ultimately, the reason why we overcomplicate things is because we're clueless.

Which is to say that we don't quite know what the outcome of our actions will be, because we don't actually know what to do. 

You see, doubt and action are two ends of a competing spectrum.

When you have enough understanding and faith in your own actions, it completely eliminates all doubt and indecision in your mind.

Yet part of the problem is that before we can even doubt ourselves or even take action, we've already shut our brains off and left the room to have another slice of regret pie.

And that is the decision our brain has made. 

End of story.  

Thankfully, we can switch our brains back on again and fight back - more on this later. 

I suppose what I mean to say is that even though we have a general idea of what we should do, most of us have difficulty making it actually work. 

It's almost like we're aware of the fact that we're not actually aware. 

I like to have the comparison to meditation. 

We all know meditation is about focus and emptying all the thoughts in our heads.

However to actually do it, in our actual head, isn't quite as simple.

This is where the importance of method and pracice comes in. 

Method and practice is that last 5% we don't quite understand.

So today, I am going to explain how to stop your urges from getting the best of you. 

### It's How You Prepare Yourself

![It's How You Prepare Yourself](/img/blog/15-02.png)

There are two reasons why this particular method works.

The first reason is because it does, and the second reason is because you'll understand why it works - in detail.

Oh, how dandy. 

Because the method is largely irrelevant.

Just as their are thousands of different languages, it doesn't matter which one you speak.

The end goal is communication and that is something that goes well beyond your ability to speak or use words. 

Regardless, the idea behind this particular method is to give you confidence and prevent your cluelessness from kicking in whenever your cravings strike.

Not only by eliminating your doubts, however also by providing you with the knowledge to know exactly what to do, how to do it, as well as what the outcome will be.

Exactly. 

In other words, to be prepared. 

Like any effective method, it will rely on your ability to practice and take action, which is a seperate, and very different skill to understanding what to do.  

I've also come to understand that it's a truth most of us discover the hard way.

So don't say I didn't warn you. 

This article explains it a little better. 

<div class="cross-post-template">
    <a class="cross-post-template-title" href="https://juliusreade.com/2017/03/31/success-is-a-verifiable-system/">Success Is A Verifiable System</a>
</div>

Anyway, the reason why it's important to master the method, is that it takes a lot of thought out of the process.

Which is a HUGE benefit, when you no longer have to think or worry, ontop of actually preventing yourself from urges.  

Which really is to say that we tend to spend more time thinking and worrying, rather than actually doing what is actually necessary.

You know, overcomplicate. 

It's why routine and discipline are so effective.

They handle your emotions and expectations for you, so that you can simply carry on with your day.

So really, all you need to do on your behalf is to commit and actually do the thing you're hoping to achieve. 

The deliriously awkward thing about this kind of logic however, is that it only makes sense once you commit for a while. 

Again, most people end up learning the hard way, or perhaps not at all.

Thankfully this method doesn't require a lot of faith or commitment.

Because unlike marriage, it's a lot easier to walk away from an addiction.

<!--Which is also to say that it is effortless. -->

### Short-Term Plan. Long-Term Plan. 

![Short-Term Plan. Long-Term Plan.](/img/blog/15-03.png)

So what exactly is the best way to be prepared?

Well, to create a plan of course! 

Very broadly speaking, in order to control our cravings (as well as our general addiction) we will need to plan ahead. 

Now there are two very basic aspects to internal planning:

There are our long-term plans and our short-term plans. 

Our long-term plans are designed to provide us with future ambition and hope. 

Essentially they are designed to provide us with reasons as to why pursuing our addiction is a poor idea, at least compared to the alternatives out there - like reading a book. 

Future ambition works because our hopes and dreams are a very, very compelling force.

...as well as a destructive one, in the world of cynicism and pessimism. 

What I tend to find is that most people who even bother considering to seriously overcome their addiction, already have this aspect down pat. 

I mean, you've made it this far within the article - which means you've already persevered through a lot of bullshit. 

It usually takes a very ambitious person to want to tackle their problems, which means you likely already have a few of them sorted out - such as your career or your completely non-existent love life. 

Usually where most people fail is in their coping mechanisms, which is what we intend to focus on. 

In other words, your ability to manage the short term. 

At a very basic level our short-term plans comprise of the individual decisions we make in our head.

Yes. We must think very, very short-term. 

And like a clock ticking in the background, these decisions dictate our every move. 

The problem with our long-term plans is that they are usually inadequate to prevent us from pursuing our urges. 

...or rather, because we fail to convey them in a way our short-term selves can understand. 

It's the reason why many people can abstain for a long period of time from their addiction, only to eventually give in. 

Don't be that guy.

Even though I clearly am that guy.

### How To Certifiably Short-Circuit Your Cravings

![How To Control Your Urges](/img/blog/15-04.png)

Now onto the exciting part of the article.

How to effectively short-term plan.

Ultimately I like to think of short-term plans as a mechanism designed to short-circuit your thoughts.

It can help to think of short-term plans as a repetitive succession of decisions and thoughts you create in your mind, to guide you away from your cravings. 

Much like a disco blinker light. 

Except instead of a succession of bright, flashing lights - it's a bunch of thoughts you create in your mind that say "no, no, no, no, no, no". 

To explain how this works, it may make more sense to explain where people go wrong in trying to manage their cravings.

Put simply, people don't know how to effectively resist. 

When the onset of craving comes along (at least for someone who is consciously aware that their addiction is not in their best interest), two things usually happen.

First the person thinks: "Oh shit, I really shouldn't do this thing".

Followed by: "but I really fucking want to".

For some reason in our heads, we think that's enough.

We think that knowing that we shouldn't do something is enough to actually stop us from doing it, at least to a point where we can influence and prevent it. 

In fact, most of us simply leave it to chance and circumstance to dictate the outcome of our cravings.

In part, because we really just want to give in. 

What a lot of people don't understand, is that you have to fight back in your head. 

And that fighting back actually works, it's just that it's something that usually doesn't occur to most people.

Either because they feel like they are fighting back, or that it's pointless.

Rather than leave it to chance, you have to mentally communicate with your brain and tell it 'No, no, no, no, no, no'.

'No, you will not do the thing. You absolutely will not do it at all'.

It works because it is a conscious attempt to defeat your craving.

Of course, this is where a lot of people fail as well.

They say 'no' once in their head, and they think that's enough.

Fuck that. 

You literally need to spam that thought, on repeat, again and again in quick succession. 

Sounds stupid, but don't beat it until you try. 

This is where I'd personally failed. I'd say no once or twice, then stop saying no because I'd assumed that if my brain didn't get it by now, then there was no point continuing to try. 

Usually this method is enough, however I'll explain some other things that also work well - so you can get a few ideas rolling in your head. 

Another thing that works really well is to actually plan exactly what you're going to do in your head.

It is literally creating a plan in your head, and it works because it prevents you from making assumptions about your outcome. 

'I am going to click on this web browser tab, then I am going to read this page, then I am going to click on the next web browser tab..." 

By stating what you're going to do, you essentially commit to doing these things in your head. 

However you have to keep it very short-term, otherwise you create loopholes for yourselves. 

In conjunction, I also like to state why doing the alternative is better. 

Often, playing on scarcity works well too.

'If I don't work on my portfolio now and prioritise getting it done, it means that I'm going to be behind. I have so much work yet to do. I must move fast.'

Though I suppose the point is, there is so much you can do - and you have to find what works for you.

Because it's easy. 

### It Doesn't Start With A Method

![It Doesn't Start With A Method](/img/blog/15-05.png)

There's one very glaring problem with this guide.

It assumes a lot about you. 

It assumes that you're me, which you are not. 

Which means that you have your ambitions in order, even your mental health to a large extent - and you're just figuring out how to do the damn thing. 

It assumes that I'm not an addict, which we all are. 

While I believe I'm close to overcoming addiction, I don't believe I'm quite there yet.

At times it goes from being the easiest thing for months at a time, to the most difficult thing as I splurge in excess per the hour. 

Though certainly, I'm a lot better than I used to be. 

I'm usually in control.  

I'm usually quite functional and ambitious. 

I think my problem is that I'm addicted to being addicted. 

Maybe it's because it's what I'm used to, but there's something about overcoming addiction that has me hooked.

As if I enjoy the masochistic struggle that ensues from giving in, as well as that final 'ah-ha' moment of no longer craving. 

At the same time, I also feel like I've become so desensitized from the whole process, that it's as if I'm no longer an addict. 

Instead, I just do the thing and then don't think about it or crave it for a couple of weeks, simply to see if it gets me addicted.

Which in a sense, almost spurs me to want to do it - which then actually gets me addicted. 

It's the most boring game of cat and mouse you'll ever witness. 

So whatever you do, it's probably in your best interest to disregard everything I've written. 

I play a good word game, but ultimately I'm an idiot. 



<!--


Something that actually works, not necessarily because of the method, but because it's something you have a strong understanding of.

Which is more important than having all the tools and resources in the world. 

You see, the reason why we overcomplicate addiction isn't because it's complicated.

Are there people in society who are balanced? 

Of course, however they are a very, very rare breed.

And I'm being generous. 





Enough about that however. 

I'm here to talk about how you can overcome addiction, or at the very least aim to normalise your cravings. 



I've found a method that largely works - at least thus far, at the inexperienced age of 24. 

A method that allows you to control your cravings, and get on with life.

It's actually quite easy. 


It works not because it's particularly special, however because it helps gap that last 5% you're likely missing.

Of course, I'll try and provide some background context - however in my particular case, it was this tiny, little thing I wasn't doing correctly which caused me to spin out of control. 

Again, it made me feel very stupid once I'd figured out why. 

Though we all have our particular weak points. 


Now, there are a lot of different reasons why this particular method works, however I've also come to understand that these reasons are less relevant than the method itself. 

The reason being that understanding why it works won't necessarily assist you in being able to do it. 

Personally, this guide doesn't do much to address our long-term ambitions. 

Again, I assume that if you're reading this article, you probably already have that down pat.

Not to mention, most people tend to struggle with their urges, more than their ability to create hope.
