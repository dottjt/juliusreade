<!-- Let's make effective communication a thing. -->

Let's talk communication.

You know, that thing most of us fail at miserably. 

"Oh, you have the most wonderfully, acidic forehead".

If it's one thing I've learnt, it's that all traumatic experiences and toxic relationships can be attributed to a lack of communication. 

And not even necessarily between people. 

Often this lack of communication can be attributed to a disconnect between our own thoughts, ideas and beliefs about who we should be. 

Whether through insecurity or misunderstanding, we can somehow manage to produce the worse in us. 

Because I guarantee my life would have turned out much differently if I'd learnt to communicate effectively as a child.

Instead, I was left to figure it out on my own. 

Which meant decades of awkward conversations and horribly destructive relationships before I somehow managed to break the cycle.

And even now, it's not quite perfect.

I still take things personally. I still manage to procure these rediculous ideas about my self-worth. 

But I'm focused most of the time, because I communicate well with myself and the people around me.

Well, at least I try. 

"Hmmmmm. Your deliciously silky crunt".

I would argue that being able to communicate effectively is one of life's biggest challenges.

A challenge that a lot of people struggle with. 

Effective communication is vital from the point of view of success, because it allows us to unrequited access to future opportunity. 

With effective communication we can convince others to listen to us, buy our products or simply 

Yet communication is much more than just about the words you read or hear. 

It is also about the reality and feeling communication conveys, and that's what I want to talk about today. 

The aim of this article is to teach you how to communicate effectively.

In particular, how we can identify and avoid bad communication - not only with ourselves, however also with others. 

Because for a lot of us, bad communication is all we know and identify with, in that little bubble of hate and cycnicism of ours. 

Hopefully this article can help you understand what it means to have positive, non-destructive relationships, where we don't feel judged or ridiculed for who we are. 

<!-- What it means to be in a non-destructive relationship -->

And to learn to become more confident people.

### Why Communication Is Important

![Why Communication Is Important](/img/blog/06-01.png)

Communication is hella' important.

It is the medium through which we learn, understand, experience and relate.

It could be with another person. It could be with ourselves.

It doesn't really matter.

Effective communication is visible, honest and free-flowing. 

It is what allows us to feel safe, comfortable and not worry about who we are. 

The reason it's effective is because it allows for a high standard of communication. 

Where thoughts and ideas can be exchanged and understood at a greater rate, without resistance. 

The crucial point here is that effective communication is honest, which essentially means that we are fully understanding and relating to whoever we are communicating with. 

Ineffective communication on the other hand is inherently dishonest, which effectively distorts our ability to understand and relate. 

Which is really fuckin' bad when you think it. 

Because when you remove the honesty, you remove your ability to hold yourself accountable.

Completely hampering your ability to prevent delusion and mental illness.

Of course, humans think they can cheat being honest.

Which is what hilariously leads to all the depression, delusion and general mania we all try to hide like headless chickens.

The truly difficult part is identifying what is what is not bad communication. 

Because even though everything can feel like shit, it doesn't mean we actually know why we do, let alone what we should do. 

What is often the case is that we can experience nothing but bad communication and assume that it normal, because it's all we've known. 

Furthermore, we can be so blinded by our fears and insecurities that we not be able to identify bad communication for what it is. 

And the worst part?

When we have to live with these people, when we have no choice. 

Later I'll talk about how we can try and identify bad communication, but before then, a small anecdote from yours truly. 

### A Case For Broken Communication

![A Case For Broken Communication](/img/blog/06-02.png)

I remember feeling shocked.

I was over at my ex-girlfriend's house to have dinner with her entire family and I remember sitting at the dinner table thinking "holy shit".

"So this is what having a family was like."

I was talking, laughing, making wildly inappropiate jokes without being seen as weird or disrespectful. 

I was having a good time with the "family" and it was completely different to how I was with my own mother. 

We didn't talk, certainly because I didn't feel comfortable talking to her. Everything had to be followed by a back-handed criticism or comment. 

We had literally nothing in common. Certainly, I don't think we liked each other. 

Eventually it got to the point where we wouldn't talk or see each other for weeks at a time, only when we incidentally happened to bump into each other in the house.

Because the only time we would ever converse was when we were arguing, which naturally led to an incredible amount of arguing, in an attempt to pass it off as normal, 

In retrospect, I never had a family in the traditional sense of love and cherish.

It was more of a loyalty system driven by heirarchy and labels. 

She was my mother, therefore I did what she said.

It was the complete opposite to communication. 

It was a dictatorship. 

Which would be fine, except there was no accountability, which eventually dissolved into abuse and chaos. 

It's not fun. Trust me. 

Now there's a lot we can learn from this. In particular, identifying what bad communication is. 

### Identifying Bad Communication

![Identifying Bad Communication](/img/blog/06-03.png)6

I think what may be of help is to outline what bad communication looks like.

Because chances are, your life may consist of nothing but bad communication and so it is all we really have to go by. 

Regardless, there's two very simple metric that usually makes sense in most situations:

If you can't truly be your honest, unfiltered self in front of others. 

The essence of bad communication is quite simple. 

If you don't feel comfortable, then it means something 

It really is that simple.

It doesn't mean you can't be made to feel comfortable. 


So what we're going to do is identify where we've been dishonest, so we can become more aware of how shit we've been.

The problem is that this will be hard. 

Hard because it's something we may not have experienced before. 



Because a) We've been lying to ourselves for so long that we've forgotten why we're dishonest. for a lot of people, 

The reason is quite 

What makes communication so crucial is that it'is the ONLY medium through which we can relate to the world. 





People often forget the role that feelings play in their lives. 

Your feelings motivate you.




### Promoting Effective Communication

![Why Do We Say Sorry?](/img/blog/06-04.png)

Certainly, there's a lot that goes into effective communication. 

A lot that I probably won't be able to cover within this article.

However the most practical piece of advice is to cut off people in your life that you do not communicate well with. 

Friends. Family members. 

Because remember at the end of the day, your mental health is one of the most important things you can have.

It's more important than family. It's more important than money. It's more important than your "friends".

Because at the end of the day, you cannot reliably have any of the above without your mental health. 

It's part of the reason why I decided to create this website: To allow people to have their cake and eat it too.

To achieve success without the 

Admittedly, I cut off a lot of people in my life. A large portion of my friends. My own mother.

Because even though some of those friendship were fun, even benefitial in a lot of ways, they were not honest.

Of course, this is just a starting point. 





I don't care what anyone says: If you're harming yourself 



Confidence is a wonderful thing.

If you don't take away anything from reading this article, understand that you should always live your life with confidence, no matter what you do.

An integral part of living with confidence is the feeling of confidence. 

Ultimately, confidence is a feeling and the two are inseperable.  






### Be A Confident Young Lad

<!-- 



You have one purpose in life. 

That purpose is to make your life, as well as the lives of the people around you, feel as real as possible. 

That means playing on all the desires and insecurities of others, in order to provide them with the best possible experience in life.  

Because quite frankly, it is the only thing people care about. 

They want to feel familiar with their thoughts and surroundings.
