Just want to say that looking back at previous articles, i have found some really f**ked up mistakes, that made sentences make no sense what-so ever. ( I really should re-read what i write).

Some mistakes include:

- Sentences that mean and make no sense

- Missing words from sentences

- VERY badly planned sentences

- Not writing enough articles based on hating anime
