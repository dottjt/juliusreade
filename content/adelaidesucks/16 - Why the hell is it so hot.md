As i look outside my front porch, i see people covered in flames; melted tar stuck to there faces screaming: "Help!!!! Help!!!! I'm on fire", and no matter how many times i see it happen, i still break into laughter, but why is it so damn hot outside? Or maybe a better question to ask: Why do i continue to wear long pants and shirts with sleeves? Well as we all know (from my past experiences with the media), i have a too large a profile, which means that ANY revealed part of my body would cause much tension between the paparazzi whether to put it on page 1 or 7. However, we can't always rely on the media , as the viewers are more reliable and honest.

A good example of this was when i personally met Greg Fleet (Google him) under the shadows of a lone parking metre, from which we argued about the many quires of being a pop star, producer and singer of "it takes two". But as far as politics goes, the heat outside is another problem that has been causing the recent deaths within a particular school of choice, (the one with kids aged between 13 and 18). So far, i believe that i have done my part for the community to try and preserve the climate and it's inhabitants.

This will include:

- my recent plans to stop showering (Although i hardly shower anyway)

- stop producing waste (even if it kills me)

- but most importantly to stop using water altogether.

But how will this lower the temperature? It most definitely won't. Which is why i also created ANOTHER guide for those who think that keeping cool is the best way to help the environment:

- Burn excess and large amounts of energy to supply power to one of my many air cooler units.

- Start wasting water for no reason.

- Waste 'well-needed' paper in Africa, to create the worlds largest fan, although it probably wont work.

So there you have it. And despite the fact that obese people sweat more, we should still aim to further help the environment through ways that don't involve me helping in any way possible.
