Something i wrote during music:

“Damn it” I shouted. Although it was a happy moment, I stared in disgust. “What the hell……….go clean yourself up”. Alex looked down and cried but I showed no signs of sympathy. “Make sure you wash around your pants as well”. He knew that he was in trouble.

As Alex walked out of the room, cheers of laughter and triumph were heard. Alex knew clearly that he was unwanted, in a gay sort of way. But he had his ways of revenge. Once a bully, Alex picked on the nicest of children, including his siblings. Often he would be referred to as the “School Bully”, during lunchtime conversations and although he did not enjoy this title, he had no choice but to accept it.

As he walked down the corridor to the toilets, to wash off the remainder on his pants and face, a message entered his head. “What am I doing?”

Many asked the same question but could not answer. Alex however, could. Towards his teen years, Alex had discovered the pleasure of “feeling himself” and although this did become an addiction in his later years, there was always one thing bothering him. The fact that his parents didn’t let him wash alone. That’s right, his so-called parents were sick pedophiles. But this didn’t annoy him as much as other things did.

A majority of Alex’s day consisted of his parent's pedophilia-type activities, including eating and completing tasks nude and often sleeping with his parents, dressed up as a puppy. Many would call this a breach of his rights and so would I. However, who could resist the temptation of a 14-year-old boy in a puppy suit? I know i would, which is why i ruin this already crap story with a good bye. Good Bye.
