The average day of my life consists of:

- 5 hours of Smash Bros.

- 3 solid hours of Smash Bros.

- 4 hours thinking about Time Splitters 2

- Remaining time used to cover myself in fragment Lotion and Pasta Sauce.

...........which begs the question..................what do i hate? (anime)

Answer: Anime. But Why?

Or perhaps we should be asking real questions like:

- Why is anime so shit?

- Does any one care beside me?

But aside the point, i decided to look further into this issue through meditation and ancient methods of healing. But did it work? Not really, but i did learn a lot about the many "Victims" of past anime addicts and former freaks. Tara Mingle, whom did not want to be named, claimed that her anime addiction was horrible and scary. She even said that anime has exposed her to a lifetime of constant pain and suffering. Fortunately however, she died later that evening of an unknown cause. Possibly because i shot her in the head. But remember. Guns don't kill people. Death does.
