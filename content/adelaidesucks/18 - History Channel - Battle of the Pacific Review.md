From beneath the soil may we unearth the many treasures from past generations, from thousands and thousands of years ago................Or we could ask our parents to bring back something nice from an Asian country, such as China. On behalf of my request i kindly asked for some Wii games to be harvested and brought back to my country of residence. But what a disaster it was.

To my surprise my parents brought back 11 Wii games. From which only 6 worked. From which 2 of those 6 i already owned. To make things worse, the remainder of the 4 games were the most shithouse of games on the Wii console. What about the review................?

History Channel: Battle of the Pacific is a pathetic excuse for a FPS, let alone a game. The controls are unexciting and tedious as you try to switch weapons, when really you don't know what the fuck you're doing (Personal problem). However, the major downfall within the game would be it's aiming system. It was so bad i stabbed myself with a kitchen knife 15 times, in order to try and relax my mind from how confusing it is. The cursor moves way too fast compared to the gun's actual movement, but moves way too slowly and uncoordinated, when trying to aim at 'finer detail' in the distance. As with the graphics....................absolute nightmare. My brother, (The one i just made up) described the game as a 'Pixel Hell' and that you should all give your money to his brother Julius....

--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Graphics: 0/10 - I think i hear my parents calling me.......

- Sound: 0/10 - It was sorta hard to hear while my ears were bleeding........

- Gameplay: 0.1/10 - Is this the bit where i traded the game in?

- Lasting Appeal: 0/10 - Let alone any 'good' appeal.

- Article worthy: 4/10 - Not my best.

Rating: Don't buy this game
