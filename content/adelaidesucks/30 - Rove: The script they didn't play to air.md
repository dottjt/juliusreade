Ransom was a very unusual name for the Greek child from Athens. All day long he would dream about the promises that one day, he like everybody else had a normal name. Unlike his name though, Ransom lived a very fulfilling life, often par-taking in seasonal trips to many destinations around the world. However, a far darker secret kept Ransom from discovering the true reasoning behind his name. A secret much more evil and terrifying than the Japanese and their effect on the world's anime-liking population..................

Which thankfully brings me to the question, why am i so popular within the Muslim community? Or more importantly, how i became to be the worlds greatest leader of much intelligence and popularity? Sure you could say I'm actually a murderer and perfected scam artist that has impressively killed many innocent people from my many inspiring looks and inner integrity. But why be negative in our current world where worrying about the simplest of problems has become our utter and foremost number one priority? Too bad for you, that many of your peers (Including your relatives and best friends) most-likely despise your existence to make themselves feel bigger than they really are. Not to mention that your face reeks of polluting lotion only found in the Serbian desert and that your unrequired ugliness can't be fixed no matter how hard you scrape the burning tar off your face...........Uh?

But don't fear, as the tar on your face is most likely a substitute for your Ritalin, which we all know; IS ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT WORSE. (Rove's audience laughs).
