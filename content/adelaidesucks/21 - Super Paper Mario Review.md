,Looking back at all the articles (Mine you idiot), i found a lot of mistakes that made me go WTF? Such as incomplete sentences and. But also a lot of words missing. But as myself, i didn't take the time to fix the mistakes, that potentially were quite obvious and "unique".

However, we gather in the woods today, to listen to to one of my reviews around the warm camp fire, that ironically begins in the couch of my living room.

The main reason why i played Super Paper Mario, was based upon the fact that i "Received" it for free, one way or another. But aside the point, the game deserves to be scrapped by all means of the imagination. It's crappy design adds to further frustration when trying to complete levels, which can be annoying at times. Even basic controls have been ruined, with the developers decision to use one button to play the entire campaign. But worst of all would have to be the $400 recommended price.

Now for $400 you can buy:

- Anime dvd
- Drugs
- "Adopt" a child (Slave)

OR

- Super Paper Mario

With my first preference being the Anime dvd (Shit........wrong answer), I think we can all agree that Super Paper Mario is a poor game, with the lowest of standards for a 2-D Platformer on the the Wii.

Cons:                       Pros:
-Everything               - Nothing to see here...............
