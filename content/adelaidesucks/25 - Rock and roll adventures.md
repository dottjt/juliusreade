As a sign of gratitude, my friends decided to buy a pre-owned version of "Rock and Roll Adventures" for $30 at JB-Hifi (For Wii). But as nice as that sounds.........................the game is basicly shit. The graphics are worse than my GBA emulator and there's enough replay value to last you 5 hours of boredom. So why did i play this game? Or possibly a better question: What kind of drugs was i taking when i played the game? But i did eventually finish it............

The game starts off with you (Or in this case ME) playing a graphically challenged character in the form of an imitation of Elvis. The main objective of the game is to attack evil instruments...........................but why? Maybe if i had paid more attention to the game and not the floor i would have actually understood how crap it was!!!!............F**k it. Just don't buy it.

------------------------------------------------------

- Graphics: 0/10 - Can't remember. I spent too much time miming the word "death" and "Kill me".

- Sound: 0/10 - Put my TV on mute to minimalise boredom.

- Gameplay: 0/10 - Don't be ridiculous..............................

- Lasting Appeal: 5/10 - Boy was it fun when i put the disk into the shredder........repeatedly.

- Article worthy: 10/10 - What do you think this is?

Rating 2.3

Overall it was definitely more of a prank than a gift...............
