The understanding of Global law and life has gradually helped/forced people to learn the essentials of living, including the way we eat, sleep and move. Even the smallest things such as our law not to kill others has taught us that killing other people is bad and often unacceptable. Other practices have also taught us much more to the understanding of life.

When a fan of anime attempts to talk to us normal people for example, we must look carefully at their tag number and their condition of previous brain washing. As humans, we all know that anime fans have been programmed for evil and have public tag numbers, in case of malfunction. In such cases, when the anime fan is trying to communicate to an "outsider" i.e 'you', we must stand at least 2 metres away from the person to ensure your safety and mental sanity, (No one likes to here people talking about anime, let alone watch it). Then immediately try and identify the tag number* from as far away as possible, while keeping your ears blocked at all times, to try and minimize the possible noise from the mentally insane person. The number will then used to hand over to government personnel to take the situation into further precaution. But what if the anime fan is a newer model that doesn't display the tag number?

When in the case that the fanatic is a newer model (pre-2006), be sure to have your cell phone pre-dialed on your country's national security hotline number, to be ready to call and alert further authority of the current situation. Don't have a mobile phone? Then now has never been a better time as the threat of an anime invasion is imminent, escpecially in Japan and in many parts around the world.

So there you have it. Remember next time when you meet someone that likes anime, be sure to have your stabbing knife out and a pre-dialed cellphone. (I'll explain the stabbing bit in Part 5)

Note*: The tag number is usually located on the neck, however it will be fairly clear when you see the person.
