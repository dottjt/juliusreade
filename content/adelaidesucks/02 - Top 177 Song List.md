Updated Randomly........................

I am Damn sick of people who say they listen to good music..............

.................Which is why i have created this blog to show the losers in society about MUSIC. But here are some question first:
-Do you want to be gay at school (or the workplace)?
-I am a complete retard?
-I have no friends and want to remain this way?
-I am still breast fed by my dad?
-I got raped by my best friend and are seeking advice?

...........just some of the reasons people have been looking at this blog, but don't fear. Primarily, I am just going to use it to post songs of interest, for the mild mannered and for those who think Peter Cundall is hot.

Hopefully u MIGHT like theses songs and enjoy the pleasure of eating rice with chips...........

Also The LIST IS (NOT) LONG AND INCOMPLETE, and will be changed in the near future........
