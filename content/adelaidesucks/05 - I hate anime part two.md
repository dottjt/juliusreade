Today we will be looking at ways to suppress the anime movement and anime enthusiasts in general. For help i asked Doctor George Flanagan and he told me that there are 3 main steps. Quote: "Remember Julius, there are three main steps............", too bad i forgot what he said afterwards which is why i Made up my own: Refuse, Convince, Tazer.

The First step is to Refuse any of the persons requests, e.g. He gives you an anime comic, then reply by Punching him in the face. However, this may not always work as some enthusiasts have been so severely brainwashed, that they don't respond to any non-anime related topics. Also know as, The anime producer. Which is why we move on to the Second Step...................

The Second step is to Convince. This often works best by using my threat method, which happily involves a death threat of some kind e.g. If you don't Drop the anime comic i will shoot you in the face. Although this may not always work, (The person may be a guns experts and knows the gun is not loaded, because he knows your a pussy and won't shoot him), then happily move onto Step 3.................

Also known a the final and "favourite" step, due to your frustration and the inability to take over the other persons mind, we resort to Physical Violence. There are many techniques in doing so, but here are just a few:

Tazer - To be honest this is one of my personal favorites as it is sure to knock that mother****er out...........

Pepper Spray - The "Cheap" option, but doesn't guarantee a clean knockout (Especially the freaks who wear masks of their favorite anime characters). Although it is fun to watch them roll on the floor and scream unknown words of pain............

Meat Cleaver - A dangerous weapon, but all the more the better. Not suggested for beginners.

.............However, the most important rule is: That we are NOT trying to kill them. All we are trying to do is Convice; Convert and Suppress, (Which may require killing them).
