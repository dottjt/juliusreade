This week (or at least i think so), i will be guiding many unguided Australian's (people) that have been struggling with exams and etc. However, you're probably asking, why the **** are you telling me after my exams? Well even miracle workers, such as myself can't answer that question, which is why we move on to the first step.

Cheat. Although i don't encourage cheating, i do "ADVISE" that you TRY it out \**wink** \**wink**. But what is the best way to perform such risky properties of achieving an A+ in an exam? From past experiences in my exams (In which i mean "It seriously wasn't me"), i find that trying the "Naruto" method helps best. This is how it works:

Now, for people who have watched Naruto, you may have seen an episode where everyone is..................fuck it. Basicly people were cheating using their "special powers" in which i will teach you in a matter of seconds*!!!!!!!

...................................By the way, i strongly discourage people to watch Naruto, just because it one of the evil forms of anime, (dare i speak about the word). However, through years of meditation and mortal training i have developed a tolerance towards the "evil" which means i can watch it (mainly because i feel like it.........sigh).

Anyways, i shall teach you these "secret techniques" with the following ingredients:

- Box of paper clips
- Jar of sugar
- Bag of sand

...............But most importantly, a lock of my hair!!!!! HAHAHAHA.................sorry. ( I decided to make this an "ingredient", simply because i know you will never obtain it. Oh well. Your such a loser).

Disappointed? Oh well, at least you might be able to get the first 3 ingredients (Provided you have friends~!!!!!!!!!, unlike me HAHAHAHAHAHA....................wait a sec?)

But now i bet your wondering, "Julius you've told me absolutely nothing about preparing exams"....................which is in fact is quite true. Which sadly, is why i must conclude this guide to a mere sentence. Never mind, at least you've become that little bit smarter never to read any of my articles again......................
