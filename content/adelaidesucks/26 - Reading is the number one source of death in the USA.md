As a former reader, i was confused and worried about myself and the amount of reading i was doing. That was until my doctor told me that i was reading dangerous amounts, exceeding the 4 books a year limit. Which is why i decided to stop reading altogether. But why read? It only benefits us in the most dramatic of ways and most likely will improve our range of vocabulary. Even our teachers encourage us to read and learn to improve our former selfs. So i say, Refuse, Annoy and Take drugs.

"Refuse", what my parents once told me as a child when confronting against strangers and pedophiles. So as a teacher or 'smart person' approaches, simply refuse their request to read, learn or interact with their language of choice. But as we all know, I'd rather respond to a teacher than cop a suspension. Which is why we move on to the second step.

Annoy. I really should have thought more carefully about my choices because annoying the teacher would only make the situation worse. Damn it. Just move on to the third step.

Take drugs etc. Now after you've been suspended from your school due to 'unresponsive reasons' (assuming that you're a retard), you might want to take up drugs, smoking or a combination to help 'sober up' from all your mishaps. Trust me, it works..........

So now that you feel much happier with yourself and life in general, you may begin to feel a sight urge of regret in your life and possibly, 'turn against yourself'. But as far as suicide and cutting your wrists go, there are more important things in life instead of dying. Unfortunately i haven't written a guide for it and probably never will. Oh well, at least you lived a good life with a Dependant and loving family. If you didn't, you probably spent half your lonely day, figuring out possible death routes for favored low-life Darryl Summers.....................................
