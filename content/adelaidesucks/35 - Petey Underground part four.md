Petey unlike other more fortunate children, wished and only dreamed of a normal life. Each day he would wake up to a world filled with concerned people facing him on the train, staring with evil thoughts, beyond his quirky smile and branded him as different. Minors stared diligently in caution at Petey, praying and hoping he wouldn't merrily attack them with his rumored claws and fangs. Even teachers and peers unsurprisingly feared Petey with a certain type of hatred, that could not be broken, let alone seen before in somebody's expression and dedication to hating Pete. Intensifying as the days past, teachers would often cane Petey for the most minimal of errors.

"Sorry sir............", Petey whispered in a delusional voice. "I seriously didn't mean it". Petey knew he was in trouble, despite the harmless amount of disturbance he had accumulated.
"How dare you talk to an official persons of higher status than you in such an unworthy voice", repeated the headmaster, who was also Petey's teacher for that year. "You do know what this means", The headmaster wearily said to the whole class. Petey gulped and took his final breath before pulling his gun out and shooting Headmaster between the eyes..............

Despite hating his life Petey also feared the false evidence that somehow, somebody in his universe loved and enjoyed his company. It was something Petey had never truly experienced, but turned a blind eye on, as if it were impossible but knew that one day, he was going to meet someone who had a similar passion for death.
