May i please say (Although i have all right to say this that) there can be no equal outcome with the exsistence of this blog. Thus there are two main outcomes that either you or I must suffer. These are:

- You come to my blog and you add on to the total number of visitors to this site. This results in me being happy and you having to suffer the "bad comedy" of my articles.

Or

- You don't come to my site and nothing happens. (Basicly it doesn't add to the total number of people who visit this site and i feel................nothing, which is bad?)

Now out of these two results, we will begin to see a downfall in visitors (Althought there really aren't any) and to inform you to keep this in mind.

Thank you for your non-existent co-operation.
