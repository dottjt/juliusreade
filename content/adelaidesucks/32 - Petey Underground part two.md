Petey's constant urge to kill his closest ones, didn't at all make him happy. No matter how little or big the situation, Petey would over exaggerate and kill his beloved in the most regretful of ways. Even after 10 years of his dreadful ways, he still hasn't learnt the basics of respect for others, including himself. But there was a far deeper secret that was kept from anyone for many of years to come. For as we see, Petey is not human. He is far more complex and ruthless. Unfortunately, Petey had to find it out the hard way..........and it all happened when he was a child.

"Hey mate, pass me the ball", Petey shouted to his best know friend.
"Fuck you, and I'm not your mate", He replied. But despite the swearing, this was the usual answer Petey received from his school mates. Not only did this make him sad, but frustrated inside.
"C'mon mate just give me a kick, you've had the ball the whole time", Petey asked again. This time however, Tim stopped, as did his other friends.
"That's it Petey, I'm sick and tired of your fucking whining and being gay, so fucking stop it!!!! You shouldn't even be hanging out with us in the first place."
"But the teacher said.........", Petey said as tears slowly poured out of his eyes.
"I don't give a fuck what the teacher said. The fact is, we don't like you and no one else will, so FUCK.OFF!!!!!!", Tim aggressively shouted, as Petey ran off in tears, wondering what to do with his life.

Then suddenly, Petey regained confidence. He felt good, like never before, like nothing could stop him. Unfortunately, this would mean the turning point in his long and yet to be worse life.

"Oi, fuck head", Petey screamed at Tim, as all his friends stared in surprise at Petey. "Just watch out next time, i don't want you to hurt your pretty little face". Petey knew he had stirred something up in Tim's mind.
"What the fuck!? If you think your so tough, why don't you come over here and say that", Tim smartly said, as he knew it would be easier to bash up Petey with more support.
"Sorry, don't want to look like a prick near you guys." and it was this line that made Tim wildly charge at Petey with all his might.................But before Tim could reach Petey, something indefinitely stopped him from Reaching the weak pile of skin and bone ahead of him.

Petey pulled out a .45 handgun from his hidden pocket, closed his eyes and randomly shot at the incoming shadow as quickly as his finger would let him. Not being able to see though, Petey knew he had hit something, when his shots corresponded to the loud and expected screams from Tim. But the screaming soon stopped, and as Petey re-open his eyes to see what he had done, a corpse of his former-enemy lay only metres from where he was standing. But Petey had no where to run. He knew he would be punished to an extreme.............However, for the first time in his life, Petey felt the happiest he had ever been, and even a bit proud for himself.............
