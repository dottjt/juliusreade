In todays society people remain prone to terrorist attacks and thoughts of the liking. Everyday millions of people are out on the streets waiting to be car bombed or possibly be taken hostage by serial killers and gang rapists. Just recently, a family of six were killed by a mob of people for not speaking English. Many or possibly a majority believe that 'risk' is a factor to be blamed. Drugs and freedom are also to be blamed as a quick response to the issue. Police are already undercover trying their hardest to reveal the crime syndicates behind the attacks and further menaces to society. But what can we do as a people to try and keep such people from harming our neutral way of life?

Expert Socialist, Tim Regan yet again proved that you can protect your family from terrorists with just a few hundred dollars and a couple of household appliances, although he was reluctant to offer any information. So us at the channel 6 news team decided to make up our own:

Convert to Islam - Would terrorists attack their own kind? Of course not* but remember that you don't really believe in their faith. Seriously.

Wear a robe - People know that the stereotypical Muslim/evil dictator wears a robe of some sort, now so can you. With a couple of bed sheets and bath towels, you too can look like Osama or celebrity dictator, Saddam Hussein.

Pre-install a bomb inside your car - Everybody knows that a terrorists no. 1# target is the humble car/vehicle. So why not eliminate the threat and install the bomb before hand, so that the terrorists have 100% no chance to do the dirty work :)

Alert people about the threat of terrorism - Why not gather a few friends and spread the word that terrorism is out there to kill you. Engulf peaceful communities into fear ridden people who embrace loneliness within their lives as a way of keeping safe. Or even better. Demonstrate the dangers of terrorism to small and vulnerable children with live theater acts based on real-time death re-enactments of people in the Iraq War......................

So there you have it. Within 1-2 weeks you and your family can be safe from most threats including herpes, the flu and Chinese people. Just remember that drugs only hurt if you over dose.
