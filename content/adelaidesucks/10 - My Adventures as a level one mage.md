Under my Maplestory account (Until i realised it was possibly the worlds worst game), i adventured through the land of MapleStory, (or what ever it was called) and began the legacy which was me. As i entered the portal to the new land, i was confronted with what many would call a "blue snail", which looks easy enough to kill. Which is when i came to my common senses................................

Up until this point i pity the fools who play that game, as it is truly a boring and unpleasant experience. 30 minutes into the game i was killed by a ****ing tree stump. Now how is that fun? Over the past week i have been trying to contact Maplestory's 50 million + players about the dangers associated with the game (much like anime). However, one of the more horrifying aspects of Maplestory, is the fact that there will be a soon to be released Maplestory DS (Please kill me) ,and further more a dreaded anime series has been based on the game. In other words, Anime + Maplestory + The worst game to be created* = Another reason to suicide.

However, apart from the many and never ending disappointments about the game, it can be happily said that Maplestory has given me the opportunity to make fun of it, but more importantly, try and convince my nonexistent readers another reason not to read articles off this blog.

PS: What i actually meant was, to aware the alert consumer about the threats and bad plots of Maplestory
