Now as we all know, my personal fan base in South Korea has been requesting for a guide on "How to get laid" which is why i prepared a little something earlier on................

________________________________________________________

There are many reasons why people don't get laid, but here are the reasons why you should:

- It forces you to read this guide, which means absolutely nothing.
- Saves you money each Friday night.
- Provides a near impossible challenge, from reading this guide.

So now that we've gone through the reasons, what can we do to "Get Laid"? Although there are many popular methods e.g. Rape, we must focus on clean and legal ways in order to "Do it". Personally, expressing your feelings to the person you love, (whether that be Man, Women or Both) is most effective, as both parties can have a say about each other. But what if i am unattractive or Asian?

There isn't much that can be done, if you are unattractive to the able eye, but here are a few tips when expressing your feelings:

- Don't stare down at their Chest when they talk, (escpecially if they are a man).
- Be sure to ask the most important of questions, e.g. " Do you like porn?"
- Say what they want to hear, (Don't express your true feelings as it is most likely not going to work)

But most importantly, look interested in what they have to offer, ( Even if they start talking about anime!!!!!)

So there you have it, Just be sure to follow this guide, and you too, can have the girl of your dreams ;)

Ps: I will not be responsible if you get slapped.
