Despite the fact that this blog most definitely not keeping you informed with issues that matter, i think as a people we can say i have extraordinary talent from within. But as much as i can brag about myself, i also have the ability to work miracles, that even make the worthy cry. Which brings me to my unrelated issue...................my upcoming top ?? list which will contain the essentials components to functional music.

Despite my hard copping from the paparazzi and press, i have continued to merge as one of the most popular blogs, worldwide*. Even when you look aside the sex scandals and planned rehab, we begin to see an emerging star, outside of Hollywood, and into the virtual world. And although i could potentially crap on for hours and hours about how good i really am. I basically just want to say that i am OFFICIALLY (sorta) creating a top ?? list, as we speak (Although speaking to yourself seems kinda stupid).
