As a kind and loving person, you may be aware that there is also another side to me. Whether it may be my recent claims that the "Pham organization" are evil, or the fact that i am hot, we must now realize that there are other role models in life that can deliver far more than what i can offer. Further examples prove that not only am i unworthy, but also a person that hates reading and socializing with girls. (Because I said so)

Up until this day, (or whatever day you may be reading this), man has asked the question: "What makes the kind of person like 'Julius' prefect?" As far as my knowledge goes, all i can say is this. It's fine people like me in society that have driven lazy people like you to strive for dreams beyond the horizon. It's people like me who drive the working class to work even harder and feel proud to be who they are. However, it also is people like me who consider 'Kathryn Morris' from Cold Case to be hot. Overall though, we can say that i am a good and trustworthy person, who believes in the people and their opinions. But what kind of opinions you ask?

As a realist, i already know that people have stopped reading this article indefinitely since the first sentence and it is because of these reasons that i begin to make changes in peoples lives and improve their standard of living. Which is why i begin to think that maybe i should stop writing articles about myself and instead, the "greater" people. (Debatable)
