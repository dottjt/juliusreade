"What the hell??", Petey shouted as he carefully examined the room, while discovering that his wife was sleeping with another woman.
"Whats the matter" Jenny said, as she turned on the bedside lamp.
"Your sleeping with another woman for Fucking sake!!!!", Petey angrily claimed.
"So? It's not like I've broken the law or anything", she answered.
"But, But, But, But.............", Petey was speechless. "I don't know what to say. I thought you loved me but that doesn't seem to be the case. You disgust me......", Petey left the room in immense sadness.

"Well what a Cunt he is tha...........", but before she could finish her sentence, a knife of sharp properties came flying through the air, before it pierced her skull, which caused it to collapse into a pile of dead flesh and brain.

"How do you like that bitch!!!!", Petey exclaimed, over the screaming of the other woman in bed. It was a scream of High pitch like in many of the fictional horror movies ever so often. But unlike the one in the movies, this one pissed Petey off.
"Shut the fuck up and get over it!!!!" Petey shouted at the widow in his torn bed.... "I don't think she can hear me......", Petey whispered, as he left the room in search for a lighter and an alcohol beverage. Petey's idea of a 'solution' usually meant the instant death of a person or rather the permanent torture of his victims.

"Sorry bout before" Petey apologized, as he re-entered the room. But the reaction wasn't too pleasant.
"Get the Fuck out of here you murderer", the not-so-kind woman screamed Directly at Petey.
"Wrong answer, bitch", Petey replied, as he immediately lit the molotov cocktail. Then ''Boom!''', the apartment room of Petey's residence blew to pieces, slightly before the whole block set-ablaze.

One by one, people jumped out of their apartment windows, for a plead of survival. Petey however, was siting quietly on a park bench, slowly recovering from his quick and undetermined escape, quietly staring at his "once" apartment block deteriorate into smoke, just as if nothing had happened................
