From outside my window lies the many drug dealers, murderers and possible scum that make up my neighborhood area. On my street alone, over 500 people have been killed, raped and killed again, in a constant battle to survive, mentally and physically. Even as higher authority within the suburb regions become ever so corrupt, a greater substance of evil reeks our streets and homes, with what only can be described as an increasingly common trend among the convenient and popular parts of greater colonies in Australia.

An ever so common but dying trend, would immediately include the vast majority of people who teach their children about the prosperities of Islam and it's teachings. Or to be put in simple terms, terrorism. Over 5 million people in Victoria alone are treated with some case of viable 'rehab' solution to aid an increasing number of people from their past mishaps with the religion. But as evil and unexplainable as this seems, children from as young as 25 , have been dramatically affected from this cause of false hope.

Earlier, we interviewed drug-ridden child of 4 from Adelaide to try and capture his perspective on things. "Personally i think there's a difference between 'taking' drugs as compared to 'doing' drugs. The spelling! Hahahaha......" (Laughs, before collapsing on the floor, as he slowly regurgitates and chokes his own vomit and saliva).

So from many years of dedicated research and preparation, does mankind discover that world-wide phenomena's such as the attendant addiction of drugs, can be fixed through a combination of intense therapy and suicide, but to also eliminate the horrid thought of people on our streets that accumulate a bad reputation for our hookers and armed forces in disguise. Not to mention the greater and more important discovery that reading such articles as these is doing no good for you, or your brain.

PS: Sorry for the bad joke about spelling. (Providing that anyone reads this crap?)
