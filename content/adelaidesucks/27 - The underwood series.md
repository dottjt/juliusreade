Everyday i begin my morning with a chilled glass of milk and a couple of fish fingers. From which i work my way to a clean bowl of fruit with extra raisins. Not to be confused with my favorite dish, a banquette of spaghetti and possible combinations of dried up apple core and skin to create the perfect treat. Sometimes i even enjoy eating the quirkiest of recipes including mashed banana with butter and crumpled pear indulged in the bones of a crushed wallaby. Who knows what other methods of torture we could introduce to our recipes of choice. Stabbing was an option that never seemed to pick up in popularity. But more importantly i mostly enojy eating meat which is why i introduce: The Underwood Series.................

Last night i was lucky enough to treat my taste buds to the many flavors and body parts of lamb and cow limbs. In a boost of happiness i attempted to take a bite into the lamb ear, until the door bell rang and interrupted my meal.

In immediate frustration i ignored the door and ran to my bathroom cupboard, searching for some Viagra to try and keep me calm. But the door kept ringing. In anticipation i shouted, " Shut the f**k up!!!" in as loud and racist voice as i could. The ringing stopped, but in replacement a child-like cry was heard. Now i was pissed off.

In a further attempt to try and put an end to the noise i decided to throw household objects at the door. With my careless attitude i picked up my printer and threw it at the door. My neighbors must of thought i was crazy with the occasional 'Crash' and 'Bang' noise streaming from my house.

One by one i threw things at the door. The Lamp, bowls, boxes of cereal, were all thrown until a point where there was nothing to throw. But the crying noise would not stop. But i felt calmed.

I don't know what it was but i felt better ever since i had completely destroyed my furnishings.

I had decided that it was time to open the door and confront whom ever was outside.

Thoughts then began accumulating in my head. What if it was criminal, or even worse; a murderer!? I dropped to the floor in fear and anxiety.

I couldn't feel my feet any more. It soon affected my legs; secondly my arms; then my body; until i couldn't feel anything. I felt..........numb. I felt like crying.........but couldn't. What was wrong with me...........................................
