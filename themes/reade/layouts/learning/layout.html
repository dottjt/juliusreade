	<article class="column two-thirds services-content">

		<p>Given this website is about achieving goals and developing aspirations, I thought it appropiate to write about what I'm working towards in my life.
			
		<p>It will hopefully give you a better sense of who I am, as well as why I put myself through the relative agony of high-achievement.</p>

		<p>I want to become a computer programmer.</p>

		<p>I didn't know I wanted to become a computer programmer until I was 22. In fact, I completely loathed computer programming up until then.</p>

		<p>I'm not entirely sure what clicked (or perhaps broke) in my brain, however I now love computer programming like you cannot believe. I read Hacker News every day and I could talk about the subject for hours.  </p>

		<p>Like, not just one facet of programming. I love low-level languages, algorithims, data structures, electronics, embedded systems, web development, functional paradigms - you name it.</p>

		<p>This passion has also extended to maths and physics, which I think are brilliant.</p>

		<p>On average I study around 4 - 5 hours each day, reading books and coding. Usually more on the weekend. </p>

		<p>Here is a basic low-down of what I know:</p>

		<p>WHAT. I. KNOW. REALLY. FUCKING. WELL.</p>

<p>Python, JavaScript + ES6, Node.js, Express.js, React, Redux, ImmutableJS, UNIX, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, Webpack, Gulp, Wercker, Git, Pelican, Hugo, Amazon AWS, Regular Expressions. 
</p>

		<p>THINGS I'VE STUDIED IN-DEPTH, BUT HAVE NEVER USED.</p>

		<p>C, C#/Java, Clojure, Haskell, Django, SQL, WebGL.</p>

		<p>THINGS I TOYED AROUND WITH FOR A WEEK OR TWO.</p>

		<p>Cycle.js, Vue.js, D3.js, Mithril.js, Flask, C++, Elixir/Phoenix, React-Router, Docker, VirtualBox.</p>

		<p>To be honest, I wasn't quite sure what to put on this page. I'm sure I'll figure it out once I have the content rolling.</p>
