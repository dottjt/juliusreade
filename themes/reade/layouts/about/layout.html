<p>For better or worse, society favours those who are successful.</p>

<p>You can fight it, rationalise it or even pretend it doesn't mean anything: Ultimately your survival will depend on it.</p>

<p>The problem is that attaining success in any field is difficult, irrational, cruel and deeply unnatural process. 
</p>
<p>
Can't live without it. Can't live without it. That's what this website is about.</p>


<p>
	Hello. 
</p>
<p>
	Let me tell you a little bit about myself.
</p>

<p>
	My name is Julius Reade and I created this website to help people better understand and overcome the pitfalls of success.
</p>

<p>Maybe you're looking to overcome your mental health issues, become an astrophyscist or even discover your sense of passion in life.
	</p>

<p>This website can help you. </p>
		
<p>Understandably, some of us got the shit end of the stick. We developed emotional problems, hung out with the wrong crowd, maybe even developed a few too many addictions and got attached to those who amplified the worst in us.  </p>
	
<p>That's life and that's okay.</p>

<p>Good news is that humans can change. Yes, it's a messy process, however with the right guidance any individual can become motivated and ambitious enough to achieve great things. It's just a matter of practice and technique. </p>
	
	<p>While I could list all the achievements and positive lifestyle changes I've made thus far, these things are merely consequential. </p>
		<p>
		Ultimately, I am a success because I feel safe and secure. I am a success because I have control over my emotions and mental health issues and it is a foundation that allows me to do absolutely anything I want with my life. </p>

		<p>Of course, everyone has their own challenges and that's what this website hopes to address.</p>

<p>To give you a sense who I am, I wake up at 6am each weekday to study. I study for two hours in the morning before work, as well as two hours after work, in addition to weightlifting three times a week.
	</p>

<p>
	This website aims to help by providing intuitive advice on what works and what doesn't based on my own experiences with life, so you can get it right the first time. 
</p>

<p>Because the reality is, success is not a natural. Avoiding burnout from working full-time and studying more than four hours each day is not something we are normally accustomed to. Overcoming years of mental health issues doesn't happen overnight.
</p>

<p>Certainly, I'm not perfect. I still get depressed. I still relapse. I get judgemental and I break things. </p>

<p>
I'm still human in this robotic pursuit towards intellectual automation, however that doesn't mean I cannot be effective the other 95% of the time.</p>

<p>It just requires a different way of thinking, so let's do it.</p>

<p>Otherwise you never will.</p>
