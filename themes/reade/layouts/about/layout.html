<p>
	Hello. 
</p>
<p>
	Let me tell you a little bit about myself. 
</p>

<p>
	My name is Julius Reade and it is my goal to demonstrate that anyone can become successful in life.  
</p>

<p>Understandably, some of us got the shit end of the stick. We developed emotional problems. We hung out with the wrong crowd, maybe even developed a few too many addictions and got attached to those who amplified the worst in us.  </p>
	
<p>That's life and that's okay.</p>

<p>But you know what, it doesn't have to be like that. With a bit of effort, you can become a highly motivated and ambitious individual with an incredible desire to work and achieve your goals. </p>

<p>Most importantly, allow yourself the opportunity to succeed.</p>

<p>What is success? Well personally speaking, I have the privilege to say that I am  in a functional and happy relationship. I weightlift three times a week. I eat paleo. I have a career that I love, as well as a healthy set of ambitions that challenge me and allow me to grow. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The thing I feel most successful about? Having control over myself and my emotional triggers. To wake up and want to live is a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>To give you a sense of my life, I wake up at 6am each weekday to study. This provides me two hours to study in the morning before work, as well as two hours after work, primarily on public transport with my laptop. In total it allows me to study for roughly four and a half hours each day, ontop of all the other regularities of life. </p>

<p>Is it easy? Well, yes and no. It's easy because I know how to make it easy. Inherently, it is exhausting, but an exhaustion that motivates me to try harder. </p>

<p>Not everyone will want this and that's okay. Maybe my philosophies are not for you. Personally speaking, it is much better than the addiction, mental illness and shitty relationships I used to partake.</p>

<p>Certainly, I can't claim to know what you want, but if you have that same an intense drive to succeed that I do, then you've come to the right place. </p>

<p>If you're willing to do anything to make it work, to push yourself to the extreme, then I want to show you how I do it. 
</p>

<p>Of course, we all have our obstacles. We still may get depressed. We feel unmotivated at the best of times. We can't quite ditch the shitty people holding us back. </p>

<p>
	This website aims to help, by providing intuitive advice on what works and what doesn't based on my own experiences with life, so you can get it right the first time. 
</p>

<p>Because the reality is, success is not a natural. Avoiding burnout after weeks of studying more than four hours each day is not natural. Overcoming years of mental health issues does not come naturally. </p>

<p> Not that it matters.</p>

<p>Because success is above that, and you want it.</p>
