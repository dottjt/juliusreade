<p>
	Hello. 
</p>

<p>
	Let me tell you a little bit about myself. 
</p>

<p>
	My name is Julius Reade and it is my goal to demonstrate that anyone can become successful in life.  
</p>

<p>Understandably, some of us got the shit end of the stick. We developed emotional problems. We hung out with the wrong crowd, developed a few too many addictions and got attached to those who amplified the worst in us.  </p>
	
<p>	That's life and that's okay.</p>

<p>But you know what? With a string of positive decisions, I've now transitioned into a highly motivated and ambitious individual with an incredible work ethic, and above all, a framework that provides me with the opportunity to succeed in life.</p>

<p>As of writing this, I now have the privilege of being in a functional and happy relationship. I have the emotional stability to weightlift three times a week. I have a career that I love, as well as a healthy set of ambitions that challenge me and allow me to grow. I have control over myself and it is a wonderful feeling to have. </p>

<p>To give you a sense of my life, I wake up at 6am each weekday to study. This provides me two hours to study in the morning before work, as well as two hours after work, primarily on public transport with my laptop. In total it allows me to study for roughly four and a half hours each day, ontop of all the other regularities of life. </p>

<p>Is it easy? Well, yes and no. Certainly, it's tiring at the best of times, but I know it's worth it. </p>

<p>Will everyone have this? No. The addiction becomes worse. The mental illness grows. The shitty relationships get worse. It's just a statistic, nothing more, nothing less. </p>

<p>Certainly, I can't claim to know what you want, but if you have that same an intense drive to succeed that I do, then you've come to the right place. </p>

<p>You're willing to do anything to make it work. Not only faster, but better. You want that perfect combination of health, ambition and attitude. It's in your blood.
</p>

<p>Of course, many of you taking the same path are still in struggle street. You still get depressed. You can't quite ditch the shitty crowd. </p>

<p>
	This website aims to help, by providing intuitive advice on what works and what doesn't, so you don't have to make the same mistakes that I did. 
</p>
<p>Because the reality is, success is not a natural. Controlling your mind not to burnout after weeks of studying more than four hours each day is not natural. Overcoming years of mental health issues does not come naturally. </p>

<p> Not that it matters.</p>

<p>Because success is above that, and you know it.</p>
