	<p>My name is Julius Reade and I create digital products.</p>

	<p>I have been creating digital products since I was 14 yeras old, from the moment I create my first blog.</p>

	<p>Since then I have created a variety of successful YouTube channels, podcasts, radio shows, blogs and websites in ways that continue to puzzle me.</p> 

	<p>Like a curious child, I've opened every jar and tarnished every pie - leaving a digital trail of mess and unclear exasperation, as may be witnessed by my online digital footprint.</p>

	<p>I'm your mini-creative agency, albeit dysfunctional and possibly racist.</p>

	<p>Writing. My writing is what I do well, but of course EVERYONE writes so it's an ultimately meaningless endeavour.</p>

	<p>So to prove myself useful, I have specialised in coding and web development. And boy, do I love it.</p>

	<p>I could talk about computer science for hours. Low-level languages, algorithims, data structures, electronics, embedded systems, functional paradigms - yummo.</p>

	<p>I'm sure I'll figure out how to properly layout and write this page, for the time being - this is the prose I shall leave you with.</p>
